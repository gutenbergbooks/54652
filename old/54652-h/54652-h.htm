<p>In further recognition of the distinguished labours of Sir James
McNabb Campbell, <abbr title="Knight Commander, Order of the Indian Empire">K.C.I.E.</abbr>, and of
the services rendered by those who have assisted him in his work, His
Excellency the Governor in Council is pleased to order that the
following extract from Government Resolution No. 2885, dated the 11th
August 1884, be republished and printed immediately after the title
page of Volume I, Part I, of the Gazetteer, and published in every
issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;His Excellency the Governor in Council has from
time to time expressed his entire approval of the Volumes of the
Gazetteer already published, and now learns with much satisfaction that
the remaining Statistical Accounts have been completed in the same
elaborate manner. The task now brought to a close by Mr. Campbell has
been very arduous. It has been the subject of his untiring industry for
more than ten years, in the earlier part of which period, however, he
was occasionally employed on additional duties, including the
preparation of a large number of articles for the Imperial Gazetteer.
When the work was begun, it was not anticipated that so much time would
be required for its completion, because it was not contemplated that it
would be carried out on so extensive a scale. Its magnitude may be
estimated by the fact that the Statistical Accounts, exclusive of the
general chapters yet to be reprinted, embrace twenty-seven Volumes
containing on an average 500 pages each. Mr. Campbell could not have
sustained the unflagging zeal displayed by him for so long a period
without an intense interest in the subjects dealt with. The result is
well worthy of the labour expended, and is a proof of the rare fitness
of Mr. Campbell on the ground both of literary ability and of power of
steady application for the important duty assigned to him. The work is
a record of historical and statistical facts and of information
regarding the country and the people as complete perhaps as ever was
produced on behalf of any Government, and cannot fail to be of the
utmost utility in the future administration of the Presidency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. The thanks of Government have already been conveyed to the
various contributors, and it is only necessary now to add that they
share, according to the importance of their contributions, in the
credit which attaches to the general excellence of the work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole series of Volumes is now complete, and His Excellency in
Council congratulates Sir James Campbell and all associated with him in
this successful and memorable achievement.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The earliest record of an attempt to arrange for the
preparation of Statistical Accounts of the different districts of the
Bombay Presidency is in 1843. In 1843 Government called on the Revenue
Commissioner to obtain from all the Collectors as part of their next
Annual Report the fullest available information regarding their
districts.<a class="noteref" id="niii.1src" href="#niii.1" name="niii.1src">1</a> The information was specially to include their own
and their Assistants&rsquo; observations on the state of the cross and
other roads not under the superintendence of a separate department, on
the passes and ferries throughout the country, on the streets in the
principal towns, and on the extension and improvement of internal
communications. As from Collectors alone could any knowledge of the
state of the district be obtained, the Collectors were desired to
include in their Annual Reports observations on every point from which
a knowledge of the actual condition of the country could be gathered
with the exception of matters purely judicial which were to be supplied
by the Judicial Branch of the Administration. Government remarked that,
as Collectors and their Assistants during a large portion of the year
moved about the district in constant and intimate communication with
all classes they possessed advantages which no other public officers
enjoyed of acquiring a full knowledge of the condition of the country,
the causes of progress or retrogradation, the good measures which
require to be fostered and extended, the evil measures which call for
abandonment, the defects in existing institutions which require to be
remedied, and the nature of the remedies to be applied. Collectors
also, it was observed, have an opportunity of judging of the effect of
British rule on the condition and character of the people, on their
caste prejudices, and on their superstitious observances. They can
trace any alteration for the better or worse in dwellings<span class="corr" id="xd25e236" title="Not in source">,</span> clothing and diet,
and can observe the use of improved implements of husbandry or other
crafts, the habits of locomotion, the state of education particularly
among the higher classes whose decaying means and energy under our most
levelling system compared with that of preceding governments will
attract their attention. Finally they can learn how far existing
village institutions are effectual to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e239" href="#xd25e239" name="xd25e239">iv</a>]</span>their end,
and may be made available for self-government and in the management of
local taxation for local purposes.</p>
<p>In obedience to these orders reports were received from the
Collectors of Ahmed√°b√°d Broach Kaira Th√°na and
Kh√°ndesh. Some of the reports, especially that of Mr. J. D.
Inverarity, contained much interesting information. These five northern
reports were practically the only result of the Circular Letter of
1843.</p>
<p>The question of preparing District Statistical Manuals was not again
raised till 1870. In October 1867 the Secretary of State desired the
Bombay Government to take steps for the compilation of a Gazetteer of
the Presidency on the model of the Gazetteer prepared during that year
for the Central Provinces. The Bombay Government requested the two
Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Public Instruction to submit
a scheme for carrying into effect the orders of the Secretary of State.
In reply the officers consulted remarked that the work to be done for
the Bombay Presidency would be of a multifarious character; that the
article on the commerce of Bombay would require special qualifications
in the writer; that again special qualifications would be required for
writing accounts of the sacred cities of N√°sik and
P√°lit√°na, of the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, of the
histories of Sindh Gujar√°t and Ahmednagar, and of the Portuguese
connection with Western India. The Committee observed that a third form
of special knowledge would be required to write accounts of
P√°rsis Khoj√°s and other castes and tribes; that in short
the undertaking would be one of much wider scope and greater difficulty
than the preparation of the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces. Much
thought would be required before the general plan could be laid down,
and after the plan was fixed all sorts of questions as to arrangement
and treatment of particular parts would be sure to arise. In the
Committee&rsquo;s opinion local revenue officers could not as a rule
find time to devote to work of this description without neglecting
their ordinary duties; but they could correct and amplify such
information as a special officer could compile from the published and
unpublished records of Government.</p>
<p>In January 1868 the Bombay Government decided that the general
supervision and direction of the work should be placed in the hands of
a Committee consisting of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of
Public Instruction, and the Commissioner of Customs, and that an Editor
should be appointed with a small copying establishment to act under the
directions of the Committee. The Editor was to give his entire time to
the work and was expected to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e247"
href="#xd25e247" name="xd25e247">v</a>]</span>finish it in about a
year. He was to collect and arrange in alphabetical order all recorded
information regarding the towns and other places of interest in each
Collectorate, and to send printed on half margin each draft when
completed to the local officers for verification, additions, and
alterations. When the drafts were returned and corrected by the Editor,
they were to be laid before the Committee. To enable the Editor to meet
such expenses as a fair remuneration for articles contributed by
qualified persons, and also to pay for the printing of the work with
small accompanying maps, an amount not exceeding <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 12,000 was sanctioned for the total expense of the
Gazetteer including the payment of the Editor. At the outset it was
decided to place a portion of the sum sanctioned not exceeding
<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 2000, at the disposal of the
Commissioner in Sindh to secure the preparation of articles referring
to Sindh. The Committee were requested to meet at Poona in June 1868
and to report to Government on the best mode of preparing and editing
the Gazetteer and supervising its publication. The Collectors and
Political Officers were in the meanwhile requested to ascertain what
records in their possession were likely to be useful for the
preparation of a Gazetteer and what papers in the possession of others
and likely to be useful for the purpose were obtainable within their
charge. Collectors and Political Officers were requested to send their
replies direct to the Director of Public Instruction who would collect
them on behalf of the Committee.</p>
<p>In August 1868 the Bombay Gazetteer Committee, composed of Messrs.
A. F. Bellasis Revenue Commissioner N. D. Chairman, Mr. W. H. Havelock
Revenue Commissioner S. D. and Sir Alexander Grant, Director of Public
Instruction, submitted a report recommending the following
arrangements:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) That Mr. W. H. Crowe, <abbr>C.S.</abbr>, then Acting Professor
in the Dakhan College, be appointed Editor of the Gazetteer with a
monthly remuneration of <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 200 out of the
<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 12,000 sanctioned for the expense of
the Gazetteer and that he should at the same time be attached as an
Assistant to the Collector of Poona;</li>
<li>(2) That Mr. Crowe be allowed an establishment not exceeding
<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 50 a month chargeable to the grant of
<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 12,000, and such contingent charges as
may be passed by the Committee;</li>
<li>(3) That Professor Kero Luxman Chhatre be requested to assist Mr.
Crowe on various questions both local and mathematical, and that on the
completion of the work a suitable honorarium be granted to Professor
Kero;</li>
<li>(4) That agreeably to the suggestions of Major Prescott and Colonel
Francis, Mr. Light should be directed to compile for the different
districts all information in the possession of the Survey Department in
communication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e281" href="#xd25e281"
name="xd25e281">vi</a>]</span>with the Editor of the Gazetteer who was
to work under the Committee&rsquo;s orders;</li>
<li>(5) That the above appointments be made at present for one year
only, at the end of which from the Committee&rsquo;s progress report,
it would be possible to state with approximate definiteness the further
time required for the completion of the Gazetteer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals were sanctioned on the 11th September 1868. Towards
the close of 1868 Mr. (now Sir) J. B. Peile took the place of Sir A.
Grant on the Committee and Colonel Francis was added to the list of the
members. Adhering as far as possible to the arrangement followed in the
Gazetteer of the Central Provinces, which had met with the approval of
the Secretary of State, Mr. Crowe drew out the following list of

<p>In 1869 the draft articles prepared by Mr. Crowe were submitted to
Mr. (now Sir) W. W. Hunter of the Bengal Civil Service who expressed
his satisfaction at the progress made. The Committee adopted certain
suggestions made by Sir W. Hunter for the arrangement of the work and
for obtaining fuller district figures from the Marine, Irrigation,
Cotton, and Survey Offices. In March 1870 a further extension of one
year was accorded. The Bombay Government directed that each Collector
should choose one of his Assistants to correspond with the Editor and
obtain for him all possible information from local records. All Heads
of Offices were also desired to exert themselves zealously in aiding
the prosecution of the work. In 1871 Mr. Crowe&rsquo;s draft article on
the Dh√°rw√°r District was sent to Mr. Hunter for opinion
who in addition to detailed criticism on various points made the
following general remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;My own conception of the work is that, in
return for a couple of days&rsquo; reading, the Account should give a
new Collector a comprehensive, and, at the same time, a distinct idea
of the district which he has been sent to administer. Mere reading can
never supersede practical experience in the district administration.
But a succinct and well conceived district account is capable of
antedating the acquisition of such personal experience by many months
and of both facilitating and systematising a Collector&rsquo;s personal
enquiries. The Compiler does not seem to have caught the points on
which a Collector would naturally consult the Account. In order that
the Editor should understand these points it is necessary that he
should have had practical acquaintance with district administration and
that he should himself have experienced the difficulties which beset an
officer on his taking charge of a district or sub-division. The
individual points will differ according to the character of the
country. For example in deltaic districts the important question is the
control of rivers; in dry districts it is the subject of water-supply.
But in all cases a District Account besides dealing with the local
specialties should furnish an historical narration of its revenue and
expenditure since it passed under the British rule, of the sums which
we have taken from it in taxes, and of the amount which we have
returned to it in the protection of property and person and the other
charges of civil government.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir William Hunter laid much stress on the necessity of stating the
authority on the strength of which any statement is made and of the
propriety of avoiding anything like libels on persons or classes. In
1871 Sir W. Hunter was appointed Director General of Statistics to the
Government of India. In this capacity he was to be a central guiding
authority whose duty it was to see that each of the Provincial
Gazetteers contained the materials requisite for the comparative
statistics of the Empire. As some of the Bombay District Accounts were
incomplete and as it was thought advisable to embody in the District
Accounts the results of the general Census of 1872, it was decided, in
October 1871, that pending the completion of the census <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e584" href="#xd25e584" name="xd25e584">viii</a>]</span>the Gazetteer work should be suspended and
that when the results of the census were compiled and classified a
special officer should be appointed for a period of six months to
revise and complete the drafts. In October 1871, pending the
compilation of the census returns, Mr. Crowe was appointed Assistant
Collector at Shol√°pur and the Gazetteer records were left in a
room in the Poona Collector&rsquo;s Office. In September 1872 the whole
of the Gazetteer records, including thirty-one articles on British
Districts and Native States, were stolen by two youths who had been
serving in the Collector&rsquo;s Office as peons. These youths finding
the Gazetteer office room unoccupied stole the papers piece by piece
for the sake of the trifling amount they fetched as waste paper. Search
resulted in the recovery in an imperfect state of seven of the
thirty-one drafts. The youths were convicted and sentenced to a
year&rsquo;s imprisonment in the Poona Reformatory.</p>
<p>In 1873 Mr. Francis Chapman then Chief Secretary to Government took
the preparation of the Gazetteer under his personal control. And in
June 1873 Mr. James M. Campbell, <abbr>C.S.</abbr>, was appointed
Compiler. An important change introduced by Mr. Chapman was to separate
from the preparation of the series of District Manuals certain general
subjects and to arrange for the preparation of accounts of those
general subjects by specially qualified contributors. The subjects so
set apart and allotted were:</p>

<p>These arrangements resulted in the preparation of the following
papers each of which on receipt was printed in pamphlet form:</p>
<p>I. <span class="sc">Ethnology</span>; II. <span class="sc">Meteorology</span>; III. <span class="sc">Geology</span>; and IV.
<span class="sc">Botany</span>.</p>
<p>Of these papers it has not been deemed advisable to reprint Dr. J.
Wilson&rsquo;s Paper on Castes as it was incomplete owing to Dr.
Wilson&rsquo;s death in 1875. Reprinting was also unnecessary in the
case of Mr. Blandford&rsquo;s Geology and of the late Mr.
Chambers&rsquo; Meteorology, as the contents of these pamphlets have
been embodied in works <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e676" href="#xd25e676" name="xd25e676">ix</a>]</span>specially devoted to the
subject of those contributions. Dr. Burgess never prepared his article
on the Arch&aelig;ology of the Presidency, but the materials supplied
by the late Pandit <span class="corr" id="xd25e678" title="Source: Bhagv√°nlal">Bhagv√°nl√°l</span> Indraji
prevented the evil effect which this failure would otherwise have
caused. Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd25e681" title="Source: Bhagv√°nlal">Bhagv√°nl√°l</span> also ably
supplied the deficiency caused by Dr. G. B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s failure to
contribute an article on the Early History of Gujar√°t. The
notices of the manufactures in the more important industrial centres to
some extent supply the blank caused by the absence of Mr. Terry&rsquo;s
contribution. Nothing came of the late Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s Account of
the Trade of the Presidency.</p>
<p>On the important subject of Botany besides Dr. W. Gray&rsquo;s
original contribution, a valuable paper On Useful Trees and Plants was
prepared by Dr. J. C. Lisboa, and a detailed account of Kaira field
trees by the late Mr. G. H. D. Wilson of the Bombay Civil Service.
These three papers together form a separate Botany Volume No. XXV.</p>
<p>The general contributions on History contained in Vol. I. Parts I.
and II. are among the most valuable portions of the Gazetteer. Besides
the shorter papers by Mr. L. R. Ashburner, <abbr title="Companion, Order of the Star of India">C.S.I.</abbr>, on the
Gujar√°t Mutinies of 1857, by Mr. J. A. Baines, <abbr title="Companion, Order of the Star of India">C.S.I.</abbr>, on the
Mar√°th√°s in Gujar√°t, by Mr. W. W. Loch,
<abbr title="Indian Civil Service">I.C.S.</abbr>, on the
Musalm√°n and Mar√°tha histories of Kh√°ndesh and the
Bombay Dakhan, and by the late Colonel E. W. West, <abbr title="Imperial Service Corps">I.S.C<span class="corr" id="xd25e699" title="Not in source">.</span></abbr>, on the modern history of the Southern
Mar√°tha districts, there are the Reverend A. K. Nairne&rsquo;s
History of the Konkan which is specially rich in the Portuguese period
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1500&ndash;1750), the late Colonel
J. W. Watson&rsquo;s Musalm√°ns of Gujar√°t with additions
by Kh√°n S√°heb Fazl Lutfullah Far&iacute;di of Surat, and
the important original histories of the Early Dakhan by Professor
R√°mkrishna Gop√°l Bhand√°rkar, <abbr title="Companion, Order of the Indian Empire">C.I.E.</abbr>, <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr>, and of the Southern Mar√°tha
districts by Mr. J. F. Fleet, <abbr title="Indian Civil Service">I.C.S.</abbr>, <abbr title="Companion, Order of the Indian Empire">C.I.E.</abbr>, <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr> With these the early history of
Gujar√°t from materials supplied by the late Pandit
Bhagv√°nl√°l Indraji, <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr>, is perhaps not unworthy to rank.
The work of completing Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s history was
one of special difficulty. No satisfactory result would have been
obtained had it not been for the valuable assistance received from Mr.
A. M. T. Jackson, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, of the
Indian Civil Service.</p>
<p>The importance and the interest of the great subject of Population
have added several contributions to the Reverend Doctor J.
Wilson&rsquo;s original pamphlet of twenty-three pages. Most of these
contributions appear in different District Statistical Accounts
especially Dr. John Pollen&rsquo;s, <abbr title="Indian Civil Service">I.C.S.</abbr>, accounts in Kh√°ndesh, Mr.
Cumine&rsquo;s, <abbr title="Indian Civil Service">I.C.S.</abbr> in
Bij√°pur, Mr. K. Raghun√°thji&rsquo;s in Th√°na and

P. F. DeSouza&rsquo;s in K√°nara, and the late R√°o
Bah√°dur Trimalrao&rsquo;s in Dh√°rw√°r. Except the
valuable articles contributed in the Statistical Account of Kachh by
Major J. W. Wray, Mr. Vin√°yakr√°o N√°r√°yanand
R√°o S√°heb Dalpatr√°m Pr√°njivan Khakhar, in
the Account of <span class="corr" id="xd25e738" title="Source: K√°thiaw√°r">K√°thi√°w√°r</span>
by the late Colonel L. C. Barton, and in the Account of Rewa
K√°ntha by R√°o Bah√°dur Nandshankar
Tulj√°shankar the early date at which the Gujar√°t
Statistical Accounts were published prevented the preparation of
detailed articles on population. This omission has now been supplied in
a separate volume No. IX. The chief contributions to this volume are
R√°o Bah√°dur Bhimbh√°i
Kirp√°r√°m&rsquo;s Hindus, Kh√°n S√°heb Fazl
Lutfullah Far&iacute;di&rsquo;s Musalm√°ns, and Messrs. Kharsetji
N. Servai and Bamanji B. Patel&rsquo;s P√°rsis.</p>
<p>Besides to these general contributors the series of Statistical
Accounts owes much of their fullness and practical usefulness to
District Officers especially to the labours of the District Compilers
who in most cases were either Collectors or Assistant Collectors. The

The names of numerous other contributors both in and out of Government
service who gave help in compiling information connected with their
districts have been shewn in the body of each District Statistical
Account. Of these the learned and most ungrudging assistance received
from Dr. J. Gerson DaCunha of Bombay requires special recognition.</p>
<p>The third main source of preparation was the Compiler&rsquo;s
head-quarters office. Through the interest which Mr. Francis Chapman
took in the Gazetteer the Compiler was able to secure the services as
Assistant of R√°o B√°h√°dur Bhimbh√°i
Kirp√°r√°m who was Head Accountant in the Kaira Treasury
when the Statistical Account of Kaira was under preparation in 1874.
Mr. Bhimbh√°i&rsquo;s minute knowledge of administrative detail,
his power of asking for information in the form least troublesome to
district establishments, and of checking the information received,
together with his talent for directing the work at head-quarters formed
one of the most important elements in the success of the Gazetteer
arrangements. Besides to the interest taken by Mr. Francis Chapman the
Gazetteer owed much to the advice and to the support of Sir W. W.
Hunter, who, in spite of the delay and expense which it involved,
secured the full record of the survey and other details in which the
Bombay revenue system is specially rich.</p>
<p>In addition to R√°o Bah√°dur Bhimbh√°i, the
members of the Compiler&rsquo;s office whose work entitles them almost
to a place among contributors are: R√°o S√°heb
Krishnar√°o Narsinh, who drafted many of the Land Revenue and
Survey Histories; the late Mr. Ganesh Bhik√°ji Gunjikar,
<abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many of the
Political Histories; the late Mr. Vaikunthr√°m Manmathr√°m
Mehta, <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr>, and R√°o
Bah√°dur Itch√°r√°m Bhagv√°nd√°s,
<abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many articles
on Description, Production, Agriculture, Capital, and Trade; Mr. K.
Raghun√°thji who prepared many of the fullest caste accounts; Mr.
Ratir√°m Durg√°r√°m, <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many papers on places of
interest; and Messrs. Yeshvant Nilkanth and Mah√°dev G.
N√°dkarni who drafted many of the sections on Population,
Agriculture, Capital, and Trade.</p>
<p>Other officers of Government who have had an important share in the
satisfactory completion of the Gazetteer are: Mr. J. Kingsmill the
former and Mr. Fr√°mroz Rustamji the present Superintendent of
the Government Central Press and Mr. T. E. Coleman the Head Examiner,
whose unfailing watchfulness has detected many a mistake. Mr. Waite the
late Superintendent of the Photozincographic Press and Mr. T.
LeMesurier the present Superintendent have supplied a set of most
handy, clear, and accurate maps. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e937" href="#xd25e937" name="xd25e937">xii</a>]</span></p>
<p>A further means adopted for collecting information was the
preparation of papers on the different social, economic, and religious
subjects which had proved of interest in preparing the earliest
District Statistical Accounts. Between 1874 and 1880 forty-nine
question papers which are given as an Appendix to the General Index
Volume were from time to time printed and circulated. The answers
received to these papers added greatly to the fullness and to the local
interest of all the later Statistical Accounts.</p>
<p>The Statistical Accounts of the eighteen British districts and
eighty-two Native States of the Bombay Presidency, together with the
Materials towards a Statistical Account of the Town and Island of
Bombay extend over thirty-three Volumes and 17,800 pages. In addition
to these Statistical Accounts 475 articles were prepared in
1877&ndash;78 for the Imperial Gazetteer.</p>

Boundaries.</span> The portion of the Bombay Presidency known as
Gujar√°t fills the north-east corner of the coast of Western
India.</p>
<p>On the west is the Arabian Sea; on the north-west is the Gulf of
Cutch. To the north lie the Little Ran and the Mev√°d desert; to
the north-east &Aacute;bu and other outliers of the
&Aacute;r√°vali range. The east is guarded and limited by rough
forest land rugged in the north with side spurs of the Vindhyas, more
open towards the central natural highway from Baroda to Ratl√°m,
and southwards again rising and roughening into the northern offshoots
from the main range of the S√°tpud√°s. The southern limit
is uncertain. History somewhat doubtfully places it at the
T√°pti. Language carries Gujar√°t about a hundred miles
further to Bals√°r and P√°rdi where wild forest-covered
hills from the north end of the Sahy√°dri range stretch west
almost to the sea.</p>
<p>The province includes two parts, Mainland Gujar√°t or
Gurjjara-r√°shtra and Peninsular <span class="corr" id="xd25e3190" title="Source: Guj√°rat">Gujar√°t</span><span class="corr" id="xd25e3192" title="Not in source">,</span> the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3195" title="Source: Saur√°shtra">Saur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> of ancient,
the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a of modern history. To a total
area of about 72,000 square miles Mainland Gujar√°t with a length
from north to south of about 280 miles and a breadth from east to west
varying from fifty to 150 miles contributes 45,000 square miles; and
Peninsular Gujar√°t with a greatest length from north to south of
155 miles and from east to west of 200 miles contributes about 27,000
square miles. To a population of about 9,250,000 Mainland
Gujar√°t contributes 6,900,000 and the Peninsula about
2,350,000.</p>

<p><span class="marginnote">Gujars.</span>The name Gujar√°t is
from the Pr√°krit Gujjara-ratta, the Sanskrit of which is
Gurjjara-r√°shtra that is the country of the Gujjaras or
Gurjjaras. In Sanskrit books and inscriptions the name of the province
is written Gurjjara-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala and G&#363;rjjara-de&#347;a the
land of the Gurjjaras or G&uacute;rjjaras. The Gurjjaras are a foreign
tribe who passing into India from the north-west gradually spread as
far south as Kh√°ndesh and Bombay Gujar√°t. The present
Gujars of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3323" title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span> and North-West Provinces preserve
more of their foreign traits than the Gujar settlers further to the
south and east. Though better-looking, the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3326" title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span> Gujars in
language dress and calling so closely resemble their associates the
J√°ts or Jats as to suggest that the two tribes entered India
about the same time. Their present distribution shows that the Gujars
spread further east and south than the J√°ts. The earliest Gujar
settlements seem to have been in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3329"
title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span> and North-West Provinces
from the Indus to Mathur√° where they still differ greatly in
dress and language from most other inhabitants. From Mathur√° the
Gujars seem to have passed to East <span class="corr" id="xd25e3332"
title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span> and
from there by way of Kotah and Mandasor to M√°lwa, where, though
their original character is considerably altered, the Gujars of
M√°lwa still remember that their ancestors came from the Doab
between the Ganges and the Jamna. In M√°lwa they spread as far
east as Bhilsa and <span class="corr" id="xd25e3335" title="Source: Saharanpur">Sah√°ranpur</span>. From M√°lwa they
passed south to Kh√°ndesh and west probably by the Ratlam-Dohad
route to the province of Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>Like the modern Ahirs of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a the
Gujars seem to have been a tribe of cattle-rearers husbandmen and
soldiers who accompanied some conqueror and subsequently were pushed or
spread forwards as occasion arose or necessity compelled. In the
absence of better authority the order and locality of their settlements
suggest that their introduction into India took place during the rule
of the Skythian or Kush√°n emperor Kanerkes or Kanishka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78&ndash;106) in whose time they
seem to have settled as far east as Mathur√° to which the
territory of Kanishka is known to have extended. Subsequently along
with the Guptas, who rose to power about two hundred years later
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300), the Gujars settled in East
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3346" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span>,
M√°lwa, and Gujar√°t, provinces all of which were

The Name.</span> subjugated by the Guptas. It seems probable that in
reward for their share in the Gupta conquests the leading Gujars were
allotted fiefs and territories which in the declining power of their
Gupta overlords they afterwards (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450&ndash;550) turned into independent
kingdoms.</p>
<p>The earliest definite reference to a kingdom of North Indian Gujars
is about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;890 when the Kashmir king
&#346;ankaravarman sent an expedition against the Gurjjara king
Alakh√°na and defeated him. As the price of peace Alakh√°na
offered the country called Takkade&#347;a. This Takkade&#347;a<a class="noteref" id="n3.1src" href="#n3.1" name="n3.1src">1</a> appears to be
the same as the Tsehkia of Hiuen Tsiang<a class="noteref" id="n3.2src"
href="#n3.2" name="n3.2src">2</a> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630&ndash;640) who puts it between the
Biy√°s on the east and the Indus on the west thus including
nearly the whole <span class="corr" id="xd25e3388" title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span>. The tract surrendered by
Alakh√°na was probably the small territory to the east of the
Chin√°b as the main possessions of Alakh√°na must have lain
further west between the Chin√°b and the Jehlam, where lie the
town of Gujar√°t and the country still called Gujar-de&#347;a the
land of the Gujars.<a class="noteref" id="n3.3src" href="#n3.3" name="n3.3src">3</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Northern Gurjjara Kingdom.</span>As early
as the sixth and seventh centuries records prove the existence of two
independent Gurjjara kingdoms in Bombay Gujar√°t one in the north
the other in the south of the province. The Northern kingdom is
mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang<span class="marginnote"><i>Hiuen
Tsiang&rsquo;s Kiu-che-lo, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;620.</i></span> in the seventh century under the
name Kiu-che-lo. He writes: &lsquo;Going north from the country of
Valabhi 1800 li (300 miles) we come to the kingdom of Kiu-che-lo. This
country is about 5000 li in circuit, the capital, which is called
Pi-lo-mo-lo, is 30 li or so round. The produce of the soil and the
manners of the people resemble those of <span class="corr" id="xd25e3406" title="Source: Saur√°shtra">Saur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>. The king is
of the Kshatriya caste. He is just twenty years old.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n3.4src" href="#n3.4" name="n3.4src">4</a> Hiuen
Tsiang&rsquo;s Kiu-che-lo is apparently Gurjjara, the capital of which
Pi-lo-mo-lo is probably Bhilm√°l or Bhinm√°l better known
as &#346;rim√°l.<a class="noteref" id="n3.5src" href="#n3.5"
name="n3.5src">5</a> Though Hiuen Tsiang calls the king a Kshatriya he
was probably a Gujar who like the later Southern Gujars claimed to be
of the Kshatriya race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"

The Name.</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Southern Gurjjara Kingdom, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;589&ndash;735.</span>The Southern Gurjjara
kingdom in Gujar√°t, whose capital was at N√°ndipuri,
perhaps the modern N√°ndod the capital of the R√°jpipla
State, flourished from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;589 to
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;735.<a class="noteref" id="n4.1src"
href="#n4.1" name="n4.1src">6</a> The earlier inscriptions describe the
Southern Gurjjaras as of the Gurjjara Van&#347;a. Later they ceased to
call themselves Gurjjaras and traced their genealogy to the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3492" title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> king
Kar&#7751;a.</p>
<p>From the fourth to the eighth century the extensive tract of Central
Gujar√°t between the North and South Gurjjara kingdoms was ruled
by the Valabhis. The following reasons seem to show that the Valabhi
dynasty were originally Gujars. Though it is usual for inscriptions to
give this information none of the many Valabhi copper-plates makes any
reference to the Valabhi lineage. Nor does any inscription state to
what family Sen√°pati Bha&#7789;√°rka the founder of the
dynasty belonged. Hiuen Tsiang describes the Valabhi king as a
Kshatriya and as marrying with the kings of M√°lwa and Kanauj.
The Valabhi king described by Hiuen Tsiang is a late member of the
dynasty who ruled when the kingdom had been greatly extended and when
the old obscure tribal descent may have been forgotten and a Kshatriya
lineage invented instead. Intermarriage with M√°lwa and Kanauj
can be easily explained. <span class="corr" id="xd25e3497" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> have never been slow to connect
themselves by marriage with powerful rulers.</p>
<p>The establishment of these three Gujar kingdoms implies that the
Gurjjara tribe from Northern and Central India settled in large numbers
in Gujar√°t. Several Gujar castes survive in Gujar√°t.
Among them are Gujar V√°ni√°s or traders, Gujar
Sut√°rs or carpenters, Gujar Sonis or goldsmiths, Gujar
Kumbh√°rs or potters, and Gujar Sal√°ts or masons. All of
these are Gujars who taking to different callings have formed separate
castes. The main Gujar underlayer are the Lew√°s and
Ka&#7693;w√°s the two leading divisions of the important class of
Gujar√°t Ka&#7751;bis. The word Ka&#7751;bi is from the Sanskrit
Ku&#7789;umbin, that is one possessing a family or a house. From
ancient times the title Ku&#7789;umbin has been prefixed to the names

Provinces where the peasant proprietors are addressed as
G&#7771;ihasthas or householders. As cattle-breeding not cultivation
was the original as it still is the characteristic calling of many
North Indian Gujars, those of the tribe who settled to cultivation came
to be specially known as Ku&#7789;umbin or householders. Similarly
Deccan surnames show that many tribes of wandering cattle-owners
settled as householders and are now known as Kunbis.<a class="noteref"

Gujar√°t is in the central section of the province known as the
Charotar and formerly under Valabhi supports the view that the founder
of Valabhi power was the chief leader of the Gujar tribe. That nearly a
fourth of the whole Hindu population of Gujar√°t are Lewa and
Kadwa Kanbis and that during the sixth seventh and eighth centuries
three Gujar chiefs divided among them the sway of the entire province

Ancient Divisions.</span> <span class="marginnote">&Aacute;nartta.</span>From ancient times the present
province of Gujar√°t consisted of three divisions &Aacute;nartta,
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3575" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>, and
L√°&#7789;a. &Aacute;nartta seems to have been Northern
Gujar√°t, as its capital was &Aacute;nandapura the modern
Va&#7693;anagara or Chief City, which is also called
&Aacute;narttapura.<a class="noteref" id="n6.1src" href="#n6.1" name="n6.1src">1</a> Both these names were in use even in the times of the
Valabhi kings (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;500&ndash;770).<a class="noteref" id="n6.2src"
href="#n6.2" name="n6.2src">2</a> According to the popular story, in
each of the four cycles or <i>yugas</i> &Aacute;nandapura or
Va&#7693;anagara had a different name, Chamatk√°rapura in the
first or Satya-yuga, &Aacute;narttapura in the second or
Tret√°-yuga, &Aacute;nandapura in the third or
Dv√°para-yuga, and Vriddha-nagara or Va&#7693;anagar in the
fourth or K√°li-yuga. The first name is fabulous. The city does
not seem to have ever been known by so strange a title. Of the two
&Aacute;narttapura and &Aacute;nandapura the former is the older name,
while the latter may be its proper name or perhaps an adaptation of the
older name to give the meaning City of Joy. The fourth Vriddha-nagara
meaning the old city is a Sanskritized form of the still current
Vadnagar, the Old or Great City. In the Girn√°r inscription of
Kshatrapa Rudrad√°man (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) the
mention of &Aacute;nartta and <span class="corr" id="xd25e3606" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> as separate
provinces subject to the Pahlava viceroy of <span class="corr" id="xd25e3609" title="Source: Jun√°gadh">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span> agrees with the
view that &Aacute;nartta was part of Gujar√°t close to
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. In some <span class="corr" id="xd25e3612" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span>
&Aacute;nartta appears as the name of the whole province including
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3615" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>, with its
capital at the well known shrine of Dw√°rik√°. In other
passages Dw√°rik√° and Prabh√°s are both mentioned as
in Sur√°sh&#7789;ra which would seem to show that
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra was then part of &Aacute;nartta as <span class="corr" id="xd25e3619" title="Source: K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;√°">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>
is now part of Gujar√°t.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra.</span>Sur√°sh&#7789;ra the
land of the Sus, afterwards Sanskritized into Saur√°sh&#7789;ra
the Goodly Land, preserves its name in Sorath the southern part of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. The name appears as
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra in the Mah√°bh√°rata and
P√°&#7751;ini&rsquo;s Ga&#7751;ap√°&#7789;ha, in

Skandagupta&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;456)
Girn√°r inscriptions, and in several Valabhi copper-plates. Its
Pr√°krit form appears as Sura&#7789;ha in the N√°sik
inscription of Gotamiputra (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) and
in later Pr√°krit as Sura&#7789;h&#7789;ha in the Tirthakalpa of

<p><span class="marginnote">L√°&#7789;a.</span>L√°&#7789;a
is South Gujar√°t from the Mahi to the T√°pti. The name
L√°&#7789;a does not appear to be Sanskrit. It has not been found
in the Mah√°bh√°rata or other old Sanskrit works, or in the
cave or other inscriptions before the third century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, probably because the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3696" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span>
include in Apar√°nta the whole western seaboard south of the
Narbada as far as Goa. Still the name L√°&#7789;a is old. Ptolemy
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) uses the form Larike<a class="noteref" id="n7.3src" href="#n7.3" name="n7.3src">7</a> apparently
from the Sanskrit L√°&#7789;aka. V√°tsy√°yana in his
K√°ma-Sutra of the third century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
calls it L√°&#7789;a; describes it as situated to the west of
M√°lwa; and gives an account of several of the customs of its
people.<a class="noteref" id="n7.4src" href="#n7.4" name="n7.4src">8</a> In Sanskrit writings and inscriptions later than the
third century the name is frequently found. In the sixth century the
great astronomer Var√°hamihira mentions the country of
L√°&#7789;a, and the name also appears as L√°&#7789;a in an
Ajanta and in a Mandasor inscription of the fifth century.<a class="noteref" id="n7.5src" href="#n7.5" name="n7.5src">9</a> It is common
in the later inscriptions (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;700&ndash;1200) of the Ch√°lukya Gurjara
and R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a kings<a class="noteref" id="n7.6src" href="#n7.6" name="n7.6src">10</a> as well as in the writings
of Arab travellers and historians between the eighth and twelfth
centuries.<a class="noteref" id="n7.7src" href="#n7.7" name="n7.7src">11</a></p>
<p>The name L√°&#7789;a appears to be derived from some local
tribe, perhaps the Lattas, who, as <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> are commonly
used for each other, may possibly be the well known
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as since their great king
Amoghavarsha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;851&ndash;879) calls
the name of the dynasty Ratta. La&#7789;&#7789;alura the original city
of the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as of Saundatti and Belgaum may have been in
L√°&#7789;a and may have given its name to the country and to the
dynasty.<a class="noteref" id="n7.8src" href="#n7.8" name="n7.8src">12</a> In this connection it is interesting to note that the
country between Broach and Dh√°r in M√°lwa in which are the
towns of B√°gh and T√°nda is still called

title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> legend
regarding Gujar√°t appears to be that of the holy king
&Aacute;nartta son of &#346;ary√°ti and grandson of Manu.
&Aacute;nartta had a son named Revata, who from his capital at
Ku&#347;asthali or Dw√°rik√° governed the country called
&Aacute;nartta. Revata had a hundred sons of whom the eldest was named
Raivata or Kakudmi. Raivata had a daughter named Revati who was married
to Baladeva of Ku&#347;asthali or Dw√°rik√°, the elder
brother of <span class="corr" id="xd25e3782" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>. Regarding
Revati&rsquo;s marriage with Baladeva the <span class="corr" id="xd25e3785" title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span>
legends tell that Raivata went with his daughter to Brahm√° in
Brahma-loka to take his advice to whom he should give the girl in
marriage. When Raivata arrived Brahm√° was listening to music. As
soon as the music was over Raivata asked Brahm√° to find the girl
a proper bridegroom. Brahm√° told Raivata that during the time he
had been waiting his kingdom had passed away, and that he had better
marry his daughter to Baladeva, born of <span class="corr" id="xd25e3788" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span>, who was now
ruler of Dw√°rik√°.<a class="noteref" id="n8.1src" href="#n8.1" name="n8.1src">1</a> This story suggests that Raivata son of
&Aacute;nartta lost his kingdom and fled perhaps by sea. That after
some time during which the Y√°davas established themselves in the
country, Raivata, called a son of Revata but probably a descendant as
his proper name is Kakudmi, returned to his old territory and gave his
daughter in marriage to one of the reigning Y√°dava dynasty, the
Y√°davas taking the girl as representing the dynasty that had
preceded them. The story about Brahm√° and the passing of ages
seems invented to explain the long period that elapsed between the
flight and the return.</p>

quitting Mathur√° went to the Sindhu country and there
established the city of Dw√°rik√° on a convenient site on

<p>The leading Y√°dava chief in Dw√°rik√° was
Ugrasena, and Ugrasena&rsquo;s three chief supporters were the families
of Yadu, Bhoja, and Andhaka. As the entire peninsula of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a was subject to them the
Y√°davas used often to make pleasure excursions and pilgrimages

Hastin√°pura or Delhi. Of the two sets of cousins <span class="corr" id="xd25e3873" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> and Arjuna were on
terms of the closest intimacy. Of one of Arjuna&rsquo;s visits to
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a the Mah√°bh√°rata
gives the following details: &lsquo;Arjuna after having visited other
holy places arrived in Apar√°nta (the western seaboard) whence he
went to Prabh√°s. Hearing of his arrival <span class="corr" id="xd25e3876" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>
marched to Prabh√°s and gave Arjuna a hearty welcome. From
Prabh√°s they came together to the Raivataka hill which
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3879" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> had decorated and where he
entertained his guest with music and dancing. From Girn√°r they
went to Dw√°rik√° driving in a golden car. The city was
adorned in honour of Arjuna; the streets were thronged with multitudes;
and the members of the Vrish&#7751;i, Bhoja, and Andhaka families met
to honour <span class="corr" id="xd25e3882" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a&rsquo;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span>

in Girn√°r of which the Mah√°bh√°rata gives the
following description: &lsquo;A gathering of the Y√°davas chiefly
the Vrish&#7751;is and Andhakas took place near Raivataka. The hill and
the country round were rich with fine rows of fruit trees and large
mansions. There was much dancing singing and music. The princes of the
Vrish&#7751;i family were in handsome carriages glistening with gold.
Hundreds and thousands of the people of Jun√°ga&#7693;h with
their families attended on foot and in vehicles of various kinds.
Baladeva with his wife Revati moved about attended by many Gandharvas.
Ugrasena was there with his thousand queens and musicians. S√°mba

Y√°davas and others were also present with their wives and
musicians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this gathering Subhadr√° came to Girn√°r
to worship and Arjuna carried her off. Eventually Vasudeva and Baladeva
consented and the runaways were married with due ceremony. The large
fair still held in M√°gh (February-March) in the west
Girn√°r valley near the modern temple of Bhavan√°th is
perhaps a relic of this great Y√°dava fair.</p>
<p>The Y√°dava occupation of Dw√°rik√° was not free
from trouble. When <span class="corr" id="xd25e3913" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> was at
Hastin√°pura on the occasion of the R√°jas&uacute;ya

battle &#346;√°lva was defeated and killed.<a class="noteref" id="n10.1src" href="#n10.1" name="n10.1src">5</a> Family feuds brought
Y√°dava supremacy in Dw√°rik√° to a disastrous end.
The final family struggle is said to have happened in the thirty-sixth
year after the war of the Mah√°bh√°rata, somewhere on the
south coast of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a near

Y√°davas and their families went from Dw√°rik√° to

strong drink. One day on the sea shore the leading Y√°dava chiefs
heated with wine began to dispute. They passed from words to blows.

<p class="footnote cont">In the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,
XX. XXI. and XXII. Mr. Hewitt has recently attempted to trace the
history of Western India back to <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;3000
perhaps to as early as <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;6000. The
evidence which makes so far-reaching a past probable is the discovery
of Indian indigo and muslin in Egyptian tombs of about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;1700 (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 206); and
the proof that a trade in teak and in Sindhu or Indian muslins existed
between Western India and the Euphrates mouth as far back as
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;3000 or even <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;4000 (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 336, 337
and XXI. 204). According to Mr. Hewitt the evidence of the Hindu
calendar carries the historical past of India into still remoter ages.
The moon mansions and certain other details of the Hindu calendar seem
to point to the Euphrates valley as the home of Hindu lunar astronomy.
As in the Euphrates valley inscriptions of the Semitic king Sargon of
Sippara prove that in <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;3750
moon-worship was already antiquated (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 325),
and as the precession of the equinoxes points to about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;4700 as the date of the introduction of the sun
zodiac (Sayce&rsquo;s Hibbert Lectures, 398) the system of lunar
mansions and months, if it came from the Euphrates valley, must have
reached India before <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;4700. The trade
records of the black-headed perhaps Dravidian-speaking Sumris of the
Euphrates mouth prove so close relations with the peninsula of Sinai
and Egypt as to make a similar connection with Western India probable
as far back as <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;6000. (Compare
Sayce&rsquo;s Hibbert Lectures, 33: <abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 326.) Of
the races of whose presence in Gujar√°t and the neighbourhood Mr.
Hewitt finds traces the earliest is the same black-headed
moon-worshipping Sumri (Ditto). Next from Susiana in south-east Persia,
the possessors of a lunar-solar calendar and therefore not later than
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;4700 (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 325,
327, 330), the trading Sus or Saus, in Hindu books known as Suvarnas,
entered India by way of Baluchist√°n and settled at P√°tala
in South Sindh. (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J.
R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 209.) With or soon after the Sus came from the
north the cattle-herding sun-worshipping Sakas (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXII. 332).
The Sus and Sakas passed south and together settled in <span class="corr" id="xd25e4083" title="Source: Surashtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> and West
Gujar√°t. At a date which partly from evidence connected with the
early Vedic hymns (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXII. 466)
partly from the early Babylonian use of the Sanskrit Sindhu for India
(<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr>
XXI. 309), Mr. Hewitt holds cannot be later than <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;3000 northern &Aacute;ryas entered Gujar√°t
and mixing with the Sus and Sakas as ascetics traders and soldiers
carried the use of Sanskrit southwards. (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 343.) Of
other races who held sway in Gujar√°t the earliest, perhaps about
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;2000 since their power was shattered
by Para&#347;ur√°ma long before Mah√°bh√°rata times
(<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr>
XXI. 209&ndash;266), were the snake-worshipping perhaps Accadian
(Ditto, 265) Haihayas now represented by the Gonds and the
Haihayas&rsquo; vassals the Vaidarbhas (Ditto, 209) a connection which
is supported by trustworthy Central Indian Uraon or Gond tradition that
they once held Gujar√°t (Elliott&rsquo;s Races, N. W. P., I.
154). Next to the Haihayas and like them earlier than the
Mah√°bh√°rata (say <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;1500&ndash;2000) Mr. Hewitt would place the

early Mah√°bh√°rata times (say between <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;1000 and 800, Ditto 197 and 209) the
Bh√°rats were overcome by the very mixed race of the Bhojas and

the chariot-driving Gandharvas of Cutch (Ditto, 273) joined the Sus and
Sakas, together passed east to Kosala beyond Benares, and were there
established in strength at the time of Gautama Buddha (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;530) (Ditto). To the later
Mah√°bh√°rata times, perhaps about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;400 (Ditto, 197&ndash;271), Mr. Hewitt would
assign the entrance into Gujar√°t of the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ras or

considers the head-quarters of the Sus and Sakas. Another Su capital
Pr√°gjyotisha which is generally allotted to Bengal he would
(XXI. 206) identify with Broach. With the Vaidarbhas the vassals of the
Haihayas he associates Surparika, that is <span class="corr" id="xd25e4139" title="Source: Sopara">Sop√°ra</span> near Bassein,
which he identifies (Ditto, 206) with the modern Surat on the Tapti. He
connects (Ditto, 266) the Baroda river Vi&#347;v√°mitra and
Vaidurga the hill <span class="corr" id="xd25e4142" title="Source: P√°v√°gad">P√°v√°ga&#7693;</span> with
the same tribe. He finds a trace of the Bh√°rats in Baroda and in
Bharati an old name of the river Mahi (Ditto, 286) and of the same race
under their name Bh√°rgav in Broach (Ditto, 289). The traditional
connection of the Bhojas with Dw√°rka is well established.
Finally K√°rp√°sika a Mah√°bh√°rata name for
the shore of the Gulf of Cambay (Ditto, 209) may be connected with
K√°rv√°n on the Narbada about twenty miles above Broach one
of the holiest Shaiv places in India. Though objection may be taken to
certain of Mr. Hewitt&rsquo;s identifications of Gujar√°t places,
and also to the extreme antiquity he would assign to the trade between
India and the west and to the introduction of the system of lunar
mansions, his comparison of sacred Hindu books with the calendar and
ritual of early Babylonia is of much interest.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

Chapter IV.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mauryas.</span> <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;319&ndash;197.</span> After the destruction of
the Y√°davas a long blank occurs in the traditional history of
Gujar√°t. It is probable that from its seaboard position, for
trade and other purposes, many foreigners settled in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and South Gujar√°t; and
that it is because of the foreign element that the Hindu
Dharmas√°stras consider Gujar√°t a Mlechchha country and
forbid visits to it except on pilgrimage.<a class="noteref" id="n13.1src" href="#n13.1" name="n13.1src">1</a> The fact also that
A&#347;oka (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;230) the great Mauryan
king and propagator of Buddhism chose, among the Buddhist Theras sent
to various parts of his kingdom, a Yavana Thera named Dhamma-rakhito as
evangelist for the western seaboard,<a class="noteref" id="n13.2src"
href="#n13.2" name="n13.2src">2</a> possibly indicates a preponderating
foreign element in these parts. It is further possible that these
foreign settlers may have been rulers. In spite of these possibilities
we have no traditions between the fall of the Y√°davas and the
rise of the Mauryas in <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;319.</p>
<p>Gujar√°t history dates from the rule of the Mauryan dynasty,
the only early Indian dynasty the record of whose rule has been
preserved in the writings of the Br√°hmans, the Buddhists, and
the Jains. This fulness of reference to the Mauryas admits of easy
explanation. The Mauryas were a very powerful dynasty whose territory
extended over the greater part of India. Again under Mauryan rule
Buddhism was so actively propagated that the rulers made it their state
religion, waging bloody wars, even revolutionizing many parts of the
empire to secure its spread. Further the Mauryas were beneficent rulers
and had also honourable alliances with foreign, especially with Greek
and Egyptian, kings. These causes combined to make the Mauryans a most
powerful and well remembered dynasty.</p>
<p>Inscriptions give reason to believe that the supremacy of
Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan dynasty (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;319), extended over Gujar√°t. According to
Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s inscription (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) on the great edict rock at Girn√°r in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, a lake called
Sudar&#347;ana<a class="noteref" id="n13.3src" href="#n13.3" name="n13.3src">3</a> near the edict rock was originally made by Pushyagupta
of the Vai&#347;ya caste, who is described as a brother-in-law of the
Mauryan king Chandragupta.<a class="noteref" id="n13.4src" href="#n13.4" name="n13.4src">4</a> The language of this inscription leaves
no doubt that Chandragupta&rsquo;s sway extended over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter IV.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mauryas.</span> <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;319&ndash;197.</span> Girn√°r as
Pushyagupta is simply called a Vai&#347;ya and a brother-in-law of king
Chandragupta and has no royal attribute, particulars which tend to show
that he was a local governor subordinate to king Chandragupta. The same
inscription<a class="noteref" id="n14.1src" href="#n14.1" name="n14.1src">5</a> states that in the time of A&#347;oka (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;250) his officer Yavanar√°ja
Tush√°spa adorned the same Sudar&#347;ana lake with conduits.
This would seem to prove the continuance of Mauryan rule in
Girn√°r for three generations from Chandragupta to A&#347;oka.
Tush√°spa is called Yavanar√°ja. The use of the term
<i>r√°ja</i> would seem to show that, unlike Chandragupta&rsquo;s
Vai&#347;ya governor Pushyagupta, <span class="corr" id="xd25e4254"
title="Source: Tus√°shpa">Tush√°spa</span> was a dignitary
of high rank and noble family. That he is called Yavanar√°ja does
not prove Tush√°spa was a Greek, though for Greeks alone Yavana
is the proper term. The name Tush√°spa rather suggests a Persian
origin from its close likeness in formation to Kersh√°shp, a name
still current among Bombay P√°rsis. Evidence from other sources
proves that A&#347;oka held complete sway over M√°lwa,
Gujar√°t, and the Konkan coast. All the rock edicts of A&#347;oka
hitherto traced have been found on the confines of his great empire. On
the north-west at Kapurdigiri and at Shabazgarhi in the
Baktro-P√°li character; in the north-north-west at K√°lsi,
in the east at Dhauli and Jangada; in the west at Girn√°r and
Sop√°ra, and in the south in Maisur all in Maurya characters. The
Girn√°r and Sop√°ra edicts leave no doubt that the
Gujar√°t, K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, and North Konkan
seaboard was in A&#347;oka&rsquo;s possession. The fact that an inland
ruler holds the coast implies his supremacy over the intervening
country. Further it is known that A&#347;oka was viceroy of
M√°lwa in the time of his father and that after his
father&rsquo;s death he was sovereign of M√°lwa. The easy route
from Mandasor (better known as Da&#347;apur) to Dohad has always
secured a close connection between M√°lwa and Gujar√°t.
South Gujar√°t lies at the mercy of any invader entering by Dohad
and the conquest of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a on one side
and of Upper Gujar√°t on the other might follow in detail. As we
know that K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and South
Gujar√°t as far as Sop√°ra were held by A&#347;oka it is
not improbable that Upper Gujar√°t also owned his sway. The
Maurya capital of Gujar√°t seems to have been Girinagara or
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4257" title="Source: Jun√°gadh">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span> in Central
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, whose strong hill fort
dominating the rich province of Sorath and whose lofty hills a centre
of worship and a defence and retreat from invaders, combined to secure
for <span class="corr" id="xd25e4260" title="Source: Jun√°gadh">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span> its continuance
as capital under the Kshatrapas (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100&ndash;380) and their successors the Guptas
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;380&ndash;460). The southern capital
of the Mauryas seems to have been Sop√°ra near Bassein in a rich
country with a good and safe harbour for small vessels, probably in
those times the chief centre of the Konkan and South Gujar√°t
trade.</p>
<p>Buddhist and Jain records agree that A&#347;oka was succeeded, not
by his son Kun√°la who was blind, but by his grandsons
Da&#347;aratha and Samprati. The Bar√°bar hill near Gay√°
has caves made by A&#347;oka and bearing his inscriptions; and close to
Bar√°bar is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter IV.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mauryas.</span> <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;319&ndash;197.</span> N√°g√°rjuna
hill with caves made by Da&#347;aratha also bearing his inscriptions.
In one of these inscriptions the remark occurs that one of the
Bar√°bar caves was made by Da&#347;aratha &lsquo;installed
immediately after.&rsquo; As the caves in the neighbouring hill must
have been well known to have been made by A&#347;oka this
&lsquo;after&rsquo; may mean after A&#347;oka, or the
&lsquo;after&rsquo; may refer solely to the sequence between
Da&#347;aratha&rsquo;s installation and his excavation of the cave. In
any case it is probable that Da&#347;aratha was A&#347;oka&rsquo;s
successor. Jaina records pass over Da&#347;aratha and say that
A&#347;oka was succeeded by his grandson Samprati the son of
Kun√°la. In the matter of the propagation of the Jain faith, Jain
records speak as highly of Samprati as Buddhist records speak of
A&#347;oka.<a class="noteref" id="n15.1src" href="#n15.1" name="n15.1src">6</a> Almost all old Jain temples or monuments, whose
builders are unknown, are ascribed to Samprati who is said to have
built thousands of temples as A&#347;oka is said to have raised
thousands of <i>stupas</i>. In his <span class="corr" id="xd25e4296"
title="Source: P√°taliputra-kalpa">P√°&#7789;aliputra-kalpa</span>

gives a number of legendary and other stories of <span class="corr" id="xd25e4299" title="Source: P√°taliputra">P√°&#7789;aliputra</span>. Comparing
Samprati with A&#347;oka in respect of the propagation of the faith in
non-&Aacute;ryan countries the &Aacute;ch√°rya writes: &lsquo;In
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4303" title="Source: P√°taliputra">P√°&#7789;aliputra</span> flourished
the great king Samprati son of Kun√°la lord of Bharata with its
three continents, the great Arhanta who established
<i>vih√°ras</i> for Srama&#7751;as even in non-&Aacute;ryan
countries.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n15.2src" href="#n15.2" name="n15.2src">7</a> It would appear from this that after A&#347;oka the
Mauryan empire may have been divided into two, Da&#347;aratha ruling
Eastern India, and Samprati, whom Jaina records specially mention as
king of Ujjain, ruling Western India, where the Jain sect is specially
strong. Though we have no specific information on the point, it is
probable, especially as he held M√°lwa, that during the reign of
Samprati Gujar√°t remained under Mauryan sway. With Samprati
Mauryan rule in Gujar√°t seems to end. In later times
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;500) traces of Mauryan chiefs appear
in M√°lwa and in the North Konkan. The available details will be
given in another chapter.</p>
<p>After Samprati, whose reign ended about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;197, a blank of seventeen years occurs in
Gujar√°t history. The next available information shows traces of
Baktrian-Greek sway over parts of Gujar√°t. In his description of
Surastrene or <span class="corr" id="xd25e4323" title="Source: Surashtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> the author of the
Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;240) says: &lsquo;In this
part there are preserved even to this day memorials of the expedition
of Alexander, old temples, foundations of camps, and large
wells.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n15.3src" href="#n15.3" name="n15.3src">8</a> As Alexander did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<span class="sc">The Greeks. <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;100.</span></span> come so far south as
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and as after Alexander&rsquo;s
departure the Mauryas held K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a till
about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;197, it may be suggested that
the temples camps and wells referred to by the author of the Periplus
were not memorials of the expedition of Alexander but remains of later
Baktrian-Greek supremacy.</p>
<p>Demetrius, whom Justin calls the king of the Indians, is believed to
have reigned from <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;190 to <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;165.<a class="noteref" id="n16.1src" href="#n16.1" name="n16.1src">9</a> On the authority of Apollodorus of
Artamita Strabo (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;50&ndash;<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;20)
names two Baktrian-Greek rulers who seem to have advanced far into
inland India. He says: &lsquo;The Greeks who occasioned the revolt of
Baktria (from Syria <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;256) were so
powerful by the fertility and advantages of the country that they
became masters of Ariana and India&#8202;&hellip;. Their chiefs,
particularly Menander, conquered more nations than Alexander. Those
conquests were achieved partly by Menander and partly by Demetrius son
of Euthydemus king of the Baktrians. They got possession not only of
Pattalene but of the kingdoms of Saraostus and Sigerdis, which
constitute the remainder of the coast.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n16.2src" href="#n16.2" name="n16.2src">10</a> Pattalene is generally
believed to be the old city of P√°t√°l in Sindh (the modern
Haidar√°b√°d), while the subsequent mention of Saraostus
and Sigerdis as kingdoms which constitute the remainder of the coast,
leaves almost no doubt that Saraostus is <span class="corr" id="xd25e4399" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> and Sigerdis
is S√°garadv&iacute;pa or Cutch. The joint mention of Menander
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;126) and Demetrius (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;190) may mean that Demetrius advanced into inland
India to a certain point and that Menander passed further and took
Sindh, Cutch, and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. The discovery
in Cutch and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a of coins of Baktrian
kings supports the statements of Justin and Strabo. Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd25e4408" title="Source: Bhagvanl√°l&rsquo;s">Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s</span>
collecting of coins in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and
Gujar√°t during nearly twenty-five years brought to light among
Baktrian-Greek coins an obolus of Eucratides (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;155), a few drachm&aelig; of Menander
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;126&ndash;110), many drachm&aelig;
and copper coins of Apollodotus (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;110&ndash;100), but none of Demetrius. Eucratides
was a contemporary of Demetrius. Still, as Eucratides became king of
Baktria after Demetrius, his conquests, according to Strabo of a
thousand cities to the east of the Indus, must be later than those of
Demetrius.</p>
<p>As his coins are found in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
Eucratides may either have advanced into
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a or the province may have come
under his sway as lord of the neighbouring country of Sindh. Whether or
not Eucratides conquered the province, he is the earliest
Baktrian-Greek king whose coins have been found in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Gujar√°t. The fact that
the coins of Eucratides have been found in different parts of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and at different times seems to
show that they were the currency of the province and were not merely
imported either for trade or for ornament. It is to be noticed that
these coins are all of the smallest value of the numerous coins issued
by Eucratides. This may be explained by the fact that these small
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter IV.<br>
<span class="sc">The Greeks. <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;100.</span></span> coins were
introduced by Eucratides into K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a to
be in keeping with the existing local coinage. The local silver coins
in use before the time of Eucratides are very small, weighing five to
seven grains, and bear the Buddhist symbols of the Svastika, the
Trident, and the Wheel. Another variety has been found weighing about
four grains with a misshapen elephant on the obverse and something like
a circle on the reverse.<a class="noteref" id="n17.1src" href="#n17.1"
name="n17.1src">11</a> It was probably to replace this poor currency
that Eucratides introduced his smallest obolus of less weight but
better workmanship.</p>
<p>The end of the reign of Eucratides is not fixed with certainty: it
is believed to be about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;155.<a class="noteref" id="n17.2src" href="#n17.2" name="n17.2src">12</a> For the
two Baktrian-Greek kings Menander and Apollodotus who ruled in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a after Eucratides, better sources
of information are available. As already noticed Strabo (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;20) mentions that Menander&rsquo;s conquests
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;120) included Cutch and <span class="corr" id="xd25e4460" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>.<a class="noteref" id="n17.3src" href="#n17.3" name="n17.3src">13</a> And the
author of the Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;240) writes:
&lsquo;Up to the present day old drachm&aelig; bearing the Greek
inscriptions of Apollodotus and Menander are current in Barugaza
(Broach).&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n17.4src" href="#n17.4" name="n17.4src">14</a> Menander&rsquo;s silver drachm&aelig; have been found

Gujar√°t.<a class="noteref" id="n17.5src" href="#n17.5" name="n17.5src">15</a> Though their number is small Menander&rsquo;s coins
are comparatively less scarce than those of the earliest <span class="corr" id="xd25e4479" title="Source: Kshatrap√°s">Kshatrapas</span> Nahap√°na and
Chash&#7789;ana (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100&ndash;140). The
distribution of Menander&rsquo;s coins suggests he was the first
Baktrian-Greek king who resided in these parts and that the monuments
of Alexander&rsquo;s times, camps temples and wells, mentioned by the
author of the Periplus<a class="noteref" id="n17.6src" href="#n17.6"
name="n17.6src">16</a> were camps of Menander in <span class="corr" id="xd25e4489" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>. Wilson and
Rochette have supposed Apollodotus to be the son and successor of
Menander,<a class="noteref" id="n17.7src" href="#n17.7" name="n17.7src">17</a> while General Cunningham believes Apollodotus to be
the predecessor of Menander.<a class="noteref" id="n17.8src" href="#n17.8" name="n17.8src">18</a> Inferences from the coins of these two
kings found in Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
support the view that Apollodotus was the successor of Menander. The
coins of Apollodotus are found in much larger numbers than those of
Menander and the workmanship of Apollodotus&rsquo; coins appears to be
of a gradually declining style. In the later coins the legend is at
times undecipherable. It appears from this that for some time after
Apollodotus until Nahap√°na&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100) coins came into use, the chief local
currency was debased coins struck after the type of the coins of
Apollodotus. Their use as the type of coinage generally happens to the
coins of the last king of a dynasty. The statement by the author of the
Periplus that in his time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;240) the
old drachm&aelig; of Apollodotus and Menander were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter IV.<br>
<span class="sc">The Greeks. <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;100.</span></span> current in Barugaza,
seems to show that these drachm&aelig; continued to circulate in
Gujar√°t along with the coins of the Western Kshatrapas. The
mention of Apollodotus before Menander by the author of the Periplus
may either be accidental, or it may be due to the fact that when the
author wrote fewer coins of Menander than of Apollodotus were in
circulation.</p>
<p>The silver coins both of Menander and Apollodotus found in
Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a are of only
one variety, round drachm&aelig;. The reason that of their numerous
large coins, tetradrachm&aelig; didrachm&aelig; and others,
drachm&aelig; alone have been found in Gujar√°t is probably the
reason suggested for the introduction of the obolus of Eucratides,
namely that the existing local currency was so poor that coins of small
value could alone circulate. Still the fact that drachm&aelig; came
into use implies some improvement in the currency, chiefly in size. The
drachm&aelig; of both the kings are alike. The obverse of
Menander&rsquo;s coins has in the middle a helmeted bust of the king
and round it the Greek legend <span class="trans" title="BASILE&#332;S S&#332;T&#274;ROS MENANDROY"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&Beta;&Alpha;&Sigma;&Iota;&Lambda;&Epsilon;&Omega;&Sigma;

<span class="sc">The Greeks. <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;100.</span></span> The reason why so
few copper coins of Apollodotus have been found in Gujar√°t
perhaps is that these copper coins were current only in the time of
Apollodotus and did not, like his silver drachm&aelig;, continue as the
currency of the country with the same or an imitated die. The date of
the reign of Apollodotus is not fixed. General Cunningham believes it
to be <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;165&ndash;150,<a class="noteref" id="n19.1src" href="#n19.1" name="n19.1src">23</a> Wilson and
Gardner take it to be <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;110&ndash;100.<a class="noteref" id="n19.2src"
href="#n19.2" name="n19.2src">24</a> Though no Indian materials enable
us to arrive at any final conclusion regarding this date the fact that
Apollodotus&rsquo; coins continued to be issued long after his time
shows that Apollodotus was the last Baktrian-Greek ruler of
Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. After
Apollodotus we find no trace of Baktrian-Greek rule, and no other
certain information until the establishment of the Kshatrapas about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100. The only fact that breaks this
blank in Gujar√°t history is the discovery of copper coins of a
king whose name is not known, but who calls himself Basileus Basileon
Soter Megas that is King of Kings the Great Saviour. These coins are
found in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Cutch as well as in
R√°jput√°na the North-West Provinces and the K√°bul
valley, a distribution which points to a widespread Indian rule. The
suggestion may be offered that this king is one of the leaders of the
Yaudheyas whose constitution is said to have been tribal, that is the
tribe was ruled by a number of small chiefs who would not be likely to
give their names on their coins.<a class="noteref" id="n19.3src" href="#n19.3" name="n19.3src">25</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"

says: The Nameless king is probably cotemporary with Abdagases

(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;70) begins a period of clearer
light, and, at the same time, of increased importance, since, for more
than three centuries, the Kshatrapas held sway over the greater part of
Western India. Till recently this dynasty was known to orientalists as
the S√°h dynasty a mistaken reading of the terminal of their
names which in some rulers is Sim&#803;ha Lion and in others, as in
Rudra Sena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;203&ndash;220) son of

<p><span class="marginnote">Two Dynasties.</span>The sway of the rulers
who affix the title Kshatrapa to their names extended over two large
parts of India, one in the north including the territory from the
K√°bul valley to the confluence of the Ganges and the
Jamn√°; the other in the west stretching from Ajmir in the north
to the North Konkan in the south and from M√°lwa in the east to

may be called the Northern the latter the Western Kshatrapas.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Name.</span>Besides as Kshatrapa, in
the Pr√°krit legends of coins and in inscriptions the title of
these dynasties appears under three forms Chhatrapa,<a class="noteref"
id="n21.1src" href="#n21.1" name="n21.1src">2</a> Chhatrava,<a class="noteref" id="n21.2src" href="#n21.2" name="n21.2src">3</a> and
Khatapa.<a class="noteref" id="n21.3src" href="#n21.3" name="n21.3src">4</a> All these forms have the same meaning namely Lord or
Protector of the warrior-race, the Sanskrit Kshatra-pa.<a class="noteref" id="n21.4src" href="#n21.4" name="n21.4src">5</a> It is to be
noted that the title Kshatrapa appears nowhere as a title of any king
or royal officer within the whole range of Sanskrit literature, or
indeed on any inscription, coin, or other record of any Indian dynasty
except the Northern and the Western Kshatrapas. According to Prinsep
Kshatrapa is a Sanskritized form of Satrapa, a term familiar to the
Grecian history of ancient Persia and used for the prefect of a
province under the Persian system of government. As Prinsep further
observes Satrapa had probably the same meaning in Ariana that Kshatrapa
had in Sanskrit, the ruler feeder or patron of the <i>kshatra</i> or
warrior class, the chief of a warlike tribe or clan.<a class="noteref"
id="n21.5src" href="#n21.5" name="n21.5src">6</a> Prinsep further notes
the Persian kings were often in need of such chiefs and as they
entrusted the chiefs with the government of parts of their dominions
the word came to mean a governor. So during the anarchy which prevailed
on the Skythian overthrow of Greek rule in Baktria<a class="noteref"
id="n21.6src" href="#n21.6" name="n21.6src">7</a> (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;160) several chiefs of Malaya, Pallava,
&Aacute;bh&iacute;ra, Meda, and other predatory tribes came from
Baktria to Upper India, and each established for himself a principality
or kingdom. Subsequently these chiefs appear to have assumed
independent sovereignty. Still though they often call themselves
<i>r√°j√°s</i> or kings with the title Kshatrapa or
Mah√°kshatrapa, if any Baktrian king advanced towards their
territories, they were probably ready to acknowledge him as Overlord.
Another reason for believing these Kshatrapa chiefs to have been
foreigners is that, while the names of the founders of Kshatrapa
sovereignty are foreign, their inscriptions and coins show that soon
after the establishment of their rule they became converts to one or
other form of the Hindu religion and assumed Indian names.<a class="noteref" id="n21.7src" href="#n21.7" name="n21.7src">8</a>

coins Northern Kshatrapa rule begins with king Maues about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;70 and ends with the accession of the
Kush√°n king Kanishka about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78.
Maues probably belonged to the &#346;aka tribe of Skythians. If the
Maues of the coins may be identified with the Moga of the Taxila plate
the date of king Patika in the Taxila plate shows that for about
seventy-five years after the death of Maues the date of his accession
continued to be the initial year of the dynasty. From their
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4910" title="Source: connexion">connection</span> with the &#346;akas, arriving in
India during the reign of the &#346;aka Maues and for nearly three
quarters of a century accepting the &#346;aka overlordship, the
Kshatrapas, though as noted above their followers were chiefly Malayas,
Pallavas, &Aacute;bh&iacute;ras, and Medas, appear to have themselves
come to be called &#346;akas and the mention of &#346;aka kings in
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4913" title="Source: Pur√°nik">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> and other records
seems to refer to them. After lasting for about 150 years the rule of
the Northern Kshatrapas seems to have merged in the empire of the great
Kush√°n Kanishka (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78).</p>
<p>Though recently found inscriptions and coins show that the
Kshatrapas ruled over important parts of India including even a share
of the western seaboard, nothing is known regarding them from either
Indian or foreign literary sources. What little information can be
gleaned is from their own inscriptions and coins. Of the Northern
Kshatrapas this information is imperfect and disconnected. It shows
that they had probably three or four ruling branches, one in the
K√°bul valley, a second at Taxila near Attak on the North-West
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4922" title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span> frontier, a third at Beh√°t
near Sah√°ranpur or Delhi, and a fourth at Mathur√°. The
last two were perhaps subdivisions of one kingdom; but probably those
at K√°bul and at Taxila were distinct dynasties. An inscription

<span class="sc">Northern Kshatrapas, <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;70&ndash;<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78.</span></span> in Mathur√° shows a
connection either by marriage or by neighbourhood between the
Beh√°t and Mathur√° branches. This is a Baktro-P√°li
inscription recording the gift of a st&uacute;pa by Nandasirik√°
daughter of Kshatrapa R√°javula and mother of Kharaosti
Yuvar√°ja. Kharaosti is the dynastic name of the prince, his
personal name appears later in the inscription as Talama
(Ptolemy&nbsp;?). From his dynastic name, whose crude form Kharaosta or
Kharaottha may be the origin of the Prakrit Chhahar√°ta and the
Sanskritised Kshahar√°ta, this Talama appears to be a descendant
of the Kshatrapa Kharaosti whose coins found at Taxila call him
Artaputa that is the son of Arta apparently the Parthian Ortus.</p>
<p>The same Baktro-P√°li Mathur√° inscription also mentions
with special respect a Kshatrapa named Patika,<a class="noteref" id="n23.1src" href="#n23.1" name="n23.1src">9</a> who, with the title of
Kusulaka or Kozolon, ruled the K√°bul valley with his capital
first at Nagaraka and later at Taxila.</p>
<p>The same inscription further mentions that the st&uacute;pa was
given while the Kshatrapa Sud√°sa son of the Mah√°kshatrapa
R√°javula was ruling at Mathur√°. The inference from the
difference in the titles of the father and the son seems to be that
Sud√°sa was ruling in Mathur√° as governor under his father
who perhaps ruled in the neighbourhood of Delhi where many of his coins
have been found. While the coins of Sud√°sa have the legend in
N√°gar&iacute; only, R√°javula&rsquo;s coins are of two
varieties, one with the legend in <span class="corr" id="xd25e4952"
title="Source: B√°ktro-P√°li">Baktro-P√°li</span> and
the other with the legend in N√°gar&iacute;, a fact tending to
show that the father&rsquo;s territories stretched to the far
north.</p>
<p>Though Kharaosti is mentioned as a Yuvar√°ja or prince
heir-apparent in the time of his maternal uncle Sud√°sa, the
inscription shows he had four children. It is curious that while the
inscription mentions Nandasirik√° as the mother of Kharaosti
Yuvar√°ja, nothing is said about her husband. Perhaps he was dead
or something had happened to make Nandasirik√° live at her
father&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Western Kshatrapas,

inscription of Sud√°sa found by General Cunningham at
Mathur√° is in old N√°gar&iacute; character. Except that
they have the distinctive and long continued Kshatrapa peculiarity of
joining <i>ya</i> with other letters the characters of this inscription
are of the same period as those of the inscriptions of the great
Indo-Skythian or Kush√°n king Kanishka. This would seem to show
that the conquest of Mathur√° by Kanishka took place soon after
the time of Kshatrapa Sud√°sa. It therefore appears probable that
Nahap√°na, the first Kshatrapa ruler of Gujar√°t and
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, the letters of whose
inscriptions are of exactly the same Kshatrapa type as those of
Sud√°sa, was a scion of the Kharaosti family, who, in this
overthrow of kingdoms, went westwards conquering either on his own
account or as a general sent by Kanishka.

South Gujar√°t his power spread in two directions, by sea to
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and from near Bals√°r by
the D√°ng passes to N√°sik and the Deccan, over almost the
whole of which, judging from coins and inscriptions, he supplanted as
overlord the great &Aacute;ndhra kings of the Deccan. No evidence is
available to show either that East M√°lwa with its capital at
Ujjain or that North Gujar√°t formed part of his dominions. All
the information we have regarding Nahap√°na is from his own
silver coins and from the inscriptions of his son-in-law
Ushavad√°ta at N√°sik and K√°rle and of his minister
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4999" title="Source: Ayama">Ay√°ma</span> (Sk. &Aacute;ryaman) at Junnar.

published specimen is one obtained by Mr. Justice Newton.<a class="noteref" id="n24.1src" href="#n24.1" name="n24.1src">12</a> Four

<p><span class="marginnote">Kshatrapa I. Nahap√°na, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78&ndash;120.</span>The coins of Nahap√°na
are the earliest specimens of Kshatrapa coins. Though the type seems to
have been adopted from the Baktrian-Greek, the design is original and
is not an imitation of any previous coinage. The type seems adopted in
idea from the drachma of Apollodotus (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;110&ndash;100). On the obverse is a bust with a
Greek legend round it and on the reverse a thunderbolt and an arrow
probably as on the reverse of the coins of Apollodotus<a class="noteref" id="n24.2src" href="#n24.2" name="n24.2src">13</a>
representing the distinctive weapons of Athene Promachos and of Apollo.
In addition to the <span class="corr" id="xd25e5018" title="Source: B√°ktro-P√°li">Baktro-P√°li</span> legend on
the Apollodotus drachma, the reverse of Nahap√°na&rsquo;s coin
has the same legend in N√°gar&iacute;, since N√°gar&iacute;
was the character of the country for which the coin was struck. The
dress of the bust is in the style of the over-dress of
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s time. The bust, facing the right, wears a flat
grooved cap and has the hair combed in ringlets falling half down the
ear. The neck shows the collar of the coat. The workmanship of the
coins is good. The die seems to have been renewed from time to time as
the face altered with age. Of Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s four
coins one belongs to Nahap√°na&rsquo;s youth, another to his old
age, and the remaining two to his intervening years. In all four
specimens the Greek legend is imperfect and unreadable. The letters of
the Greek legend are of the later period that is like the letters on
the coins of the great Skythian king Kadphises I. (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;26). One of the coins shows in the legend the six
letters <span class="sc">L L O D O-S</span>. These may be the remains
of the name Apollodotus (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;110&ndash;100). Still it is beyond doubt that the
letters are later Greek than those on the coins of Apollodotus. Until
the legend is found clear on some fresher specimen, it is not possible
to say anything further. In three of the coins the <span class="corr"

Nahap√°na is not styled Kshatrapa in any of his coins the

Dakhamit√° or Dakshamitr√°. Ushavad√°ta bears no

son-in-law of Nahap√°na, which shows that he owed his power and
rank to his father-in-law, a position regarded as derogatory in India,
where no scion of any royal dynasty would accept or take pride in
greatness or influence obtained from a father-in-law.<a class="noteref"
id="n25.2src" href="#n25.2" name="n25.2src">15</a> N√°sik
Inscription XIV. shows that Ushavad√°ta was a &#346;aka. His
name, as was first suggested by Dr. Bhau D√°ji, is Pr√°krit
for Rishabhadatta. From the many charitable and publicly useful works
mentioned in various N√°sik and K√°rle inscriptions, as
made by him in places which apparently formed part of
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s dominions, Ushavad√°ta appears to have
been a high officer under Nahap√°na. As Nahap√°na seems to
have had no son Ushavad√°ta&rsquo;s position as son-in-law would
be one of special power and influence. Ushavad√°ta&rsquo;s
charitable acts and works of public utility are detailed in
N√°sik Inscriptions X. XII. and XIV. The charitable acts are the
gift of three hundred thousand cows; of gold and of river-side steps at
the B√°rn√°sa or Ban√°s river near &Aacute;bu in
North Gujar√°t; of sixteen villages to gods and Br√°hmans;
the feeding of hundreds of thousands of Br√°hmans every year; the
giving in marriage of eight wives to Br√°hmans at Prabh√°s
in South K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a; the bestowing of
thirty-two thousand cocoanut trees in Nanamgola or N√°rgol
village on the Th√°na seaboard on the Charaka priesthoods of
Pin&#7693;itak√°va&#7693;a, Govardhana near N√°sik,
Suvar&#7751;amukha, and R√°mat&iacute;rtha in Sorp√°raga or
Sop√°ra on the Th√°na coast; the giving of three hundred
thousand cows and a village at Pushkara or Pokhar near Ajmir in East
<span class="corr" id="xd25e5101" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span>; making gifts
to Br√°hmans at Chechi&#7751;a or Chichan near Kelva-M√°him
on the Th√°na coast; and the gift of trees and 70,000
<i>k√°rsh√°pa&#7751;as</i> or 2000 <i>suvar&#7751;as</i> to
gods and Br√°hmans at D√°h√°nu in Th√°na. The
public works executed by Ushavad√°ta include rest-houses and
alms-houses at Bharu Kachha or Broach, at Da&#347;apura or Mandasor in
North M√°lwa, and gardens and wells at Govardhana and
Sop√°ra; free ferries across the Ib√° or Ambik√°, the
P√°r√°da or P√°r, the Daman√° or Damanganga,
the T√°pi or T√°pti, the Karaben√° or K√°veri,
and the D√°h√°nuk√° or D√°h√°nu river.
Waiting-places and steps were also built on both banks of each of these
rivers. These charitable and public works of Ushavad√°ta savour
much of the Br√°hmanic religion. The only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>

Ushavd√°ta, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100&ndash;120.</span> Buddhist charities are the
gift of a cave at N√°sik; of 3000
<i>k√°rsh√°panas</i> and eight thousand cocoanut trees for
feeding and clothing monks living in the cave; and of a village near
K√°rle in Poona for the support of the monks of the main
K√°rle cave. Ushavad√°ta himself thus seems to have been a
follower of the Br√°hmanical faith. The Buddhist charities were
probably made to meet the wishes of his wife whose father&rsquo;s
religion the Buddhist wheel and the Bodhi tree on his copper coins
prove to have been Buddhism. The large territory over which these
charitable and public works of Ushavad√°ta spread gives an idea
of the extent of Nahap√°na&rsquo;s rule. The gift of a village as
far north as Pokhara near Ajmir would have been proof of dominion in
those parts were it not for the fact that in the same inscription
Ushavad√°ta mentions his success in assisting some local
Kshatriyas. It is doubtful if the northern limits of
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s dominions extended as far as Pokhar. The
village may have been given during a brief conquest, since according to
Hindu ideas no village given to Br√°hmans can be resumed. The
eastern boundary would seem to have been part of M√°lwa and the
plain lands of Kh√°ndesh N√°sik and Poona; the southern
boundary was somewhere about Bombay; and the western
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and the Arabian sea.</p>

mentioned. They are simply dated <i>vase</i> Sk. <i>varshe</i> that is

records in the year 42 the gift of charities and the construction of
public works which must have taken years to complete. If at that time
Ushavad√°ta&rsquo;s age was 40 to 45, Nahap√°na who, as
Inscription X. shows, was living at that time, must have been some
twenty years older than his son-in-law or say about 65. The Junnar
inscription of his minister Ay√°ma which bears date 46 proves
that Nahap√°na lived several years after the making of
Ushavad√°ta&rsquo;s cave. The bust on one of his coins also shows
that Nahap√°na attained a ripe old age.</p>
<p>Nahap√°na cannot have lived long after the year 46. His death
may be fixed about the year 50 of the era to which the three years 41,
42, and 46 belong. He was probably about 75 years old when he died.
Deducting 50 from 75 we get about 25 as Nahap√°na&rsquo;s age at
the beginning of the era to which the years 41, 42, and 46 belong, a
suitable age for an able prince with good resources and good advisers
to have established a kingdom. It is therefore probable that the era
marks Nahap√°na&rsquo;s conquest of Gujar√°t. As said
above, Nahap√°na was probably considered to belong to the
&#346;aka tribe, and his son-in-law clearly calls himself a &#346;aka.
It may therefore be supposed that the era started by Nahap√°na on
his conquest of Gujar√°t was at first simply called Varsha; that
it afterwards came to be called &#346;akavarsha or
&#346;akasam&#803;vatsara; and that finally, after various changes, to
suit false current ideas, about the eleventh or twelfth century the
people of the Deccan styled it &#346;√°liv√°hana Saka
mixing it with current traditions regarding the great <span class="corr" id="xd25e5145" title="Source: &#346;√°tavahana">&#346;√°tav√°hana</span>
or &#346;aliv√°hana king of Paithan. If, as mentioned above,
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s conquest of Gujar√°t and the
establishment of his era be taken to come close after the conquest of
Mathur√° by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"

Nahap√°na&rsquo;s Era.</span> Kanishka, the Gujar√°t
conquest and the era must come very shortly after the beginning of
Kanishka&rsquo;s reign, since Kanishka conquered Mathur√° early
in his reign. As his Mathur√° inscriptions<a class="noteref" id="n27.1src" href="#n27.1" name="n27.1src">16</a> give 5 as
Kanishka&rsquo;s earliest date, he must have conquered Mathur√°
in the year 3 or 4 of his reign. Nahap√°na&rsquo;s expedition to
and conquest of Gujar√°t was probably contemporary with or very
closely subsequent to Kanishka&rsquo;s conquest of Mathur√°. So
two important eras seem to begin about four years apart, the one with
Kanishka&rsquo;s reign in Upper India, the other with
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s reign in Western India. The difference being so
small and both being eras of foreign conquerors, a Kush√°n and a
&#346;aka respectively, the two eras seem to have been subsequently
confounded. Thus, according to Dr. Burnell, the Javanese &#346;aka era
is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74, that is Kanishka&rsquo;s era
was introduced into Java, probably because Java has from early times
been connected with the eastern parts of India where Kanishka&rsquo;s
era was current. On the other hand the astrological works called
Kara&#7751;a use the era beginning with <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 which we have taken to be the Western era
started by Nahap√°na. The use of the &#346;aka era in
Kara&#7751;a works dates from the time of the great Indian astronomer
Var√°ha Mihira (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;587). As
Var√°ha Mihira lived and wrote his great work in Avanti or
M√°lwa he naturally made use of the &#346;aka era of
Nahap√°na, which was current in M√°lwa. Subsequent
astronomers adopted the era used by the master Var√°ha Mihira.
Under their influence Nahap√°na&rsquo;s <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 era passed into use over the whole of Northern
and Central India eclipsing Kanishka&rsquo;s <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74 era. On these grounds it may be accepted that
the dates in the N√°sik inscriptions of Ushavad√°ta and in
Ay√°ma&rsquo;s inscription at Junnar are in the era founded by
Nahap√°na on his conquest of Gujar√°t and the West Deccan.
This era was adopted by the Western Kshatrapa successors of
Nahap√°na and continued on their coins for nearly three
centuries.<a class="noteref" id="n27.2src" href="#n27.2" name="n27.2src">17</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"

<span class="marginnote">The M√°lava Era, <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;56.</span>The question arises why should not the
dates on the Western Kshatrapa coins belong to the era which under the
incorrect title of the Vikrama era is now current in Gujar√°t and
M√°lwa. Several recently found M√°lwa inscriptions almost
prove that what is called the Vikrama era beginning with <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;56 was not started by any Vikrama, but marks the
institution of the tribal constitution of the M√°lavas.<a class="noteref" id="n28.1src" href="#n28.1" name="n28.1src">18</a> Later the
era came to be called either the era of the M√°lava
lords<a class="noteref" id="n28.2src" href="#n28.2" name="n28.2src">19</a> or M√°lava K√°la that is the era of the
M√°lavas. About the ninth century just as the &#346;aka era
became connected with the &#346;aliv√°hana of Paithan, this old
M√°lava era became connected with the name of
Vikram√°ditya, the great legendary king of Ujain.</p>
<p>It might be supposed that the M√°lavas who gave its name to
the M√°lava era were the kings of the country now called
M√°lwa. But it is to be noted that no reference to the present
M√°lwa under the name of M√°lavade&#347;a occurs in any
Sanskrit work or record earlier than the second century after Christ.
The original Sanskrit name of the country was Avanti. It came to be
called M√°lava from the time the M√°lava tribe conquered it
and settled in it, just as K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and
Mev√°&#7693;a came to be called after their K√°thi and Meva
or Meda conquerors. The M√°lavas, also called
M√°layas,<a class="noteref" id="n28.3src" href="#n28.3" name="n28.3src">20</a> seem like the Medas to be a foreign tribe, which,
passing through Upper India conquered and settled in Central India
during the first century before Christ. The mention in the
Mudr√°r√°kshasa<a class="noteref" id="n28.4src" href="#n28.4" name="n28.4src">21</a> of a M√°laya king among five
Upper Indian kings shows that in the time of the Mauryas (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;300) a M√°laya kingdom existed in Upper
India which after the decline of Maurya supremacy spread to Central
India. By Nahap√°na&rsquo;s time the M√°lavas seem to have
moved eastwards towards Jaipur, as Ushavad√°ta defeated them in
the neighbourhood of the Pushkar lake: but the fact that the country
round Ujain was still known to Rudrad√°man as Avanti, shows that
the M√°lavas had not yet (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150)
entered the district now known as M√°lava. This settlement and
the change of name from Avanti to M√°lava probably took place in
the weakness of the Kshatrapas towards the end of the third century
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> When they established their sway in
Central India these M√°lavas or M√°layas like the ancient

they began a new era.<a class="noteref" id="n28.6src" href="#n28.6"

inscription of Ushavad√°ta<a class="noteref" id="n29.1src" href="#n29.1" name="n29.1src">24</a> that Nahap√°na was not a
M√°lava himself but an opponent of the M√°lavas as he sent
Ushavad√°ta to help a tribe of Kshatriyas called Uttamabhadras
whom the M√°lavas had attacked. Further a chronological
examination of the early ruling dynasties of Gujar√°t does not
favour the identification of the Kshatrapa era with the M√°lava
era. The available information regarding the three dynasties the
Kshatrapas the Guptas and the Valabhis, is universally admitted to
prove that they followed one another in chronological succession. The
latest known Kshatrapa date is 310. Even after this we find the name of
a later Kshatrapa king whose date is unknown but may be estimated at
about 320. If we take this Kshatrapa 320 to be in the Vikrama Samvat,
its equivalent is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;264. In consequence
of several new discoveries the epoch of the Gupta era has been finally
settled to be <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319. It is further
settled that the first Gupta conqueror of M√°lwa and
Gujar√°t was Chandragupta II.<a class="noteref" id="n29.2src"

M√°lwa being Gupta 80 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;399).
Counting the Kshatrapa dates in the Samvat era this gives a blank of
(399 - 264 = ) 135 years between the latest Kshatrapa date and the date
of Chandragupta&rsquo;s conquest of Gujar√°t to fill which we
have absolutely no historical information. On the other hand in support
of the view that the Kshatrapa era is the &#346;aka era the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a coins of the Gupta king
Kum√°ragupta son of Chandragupta dated 100 Gupta closely resemble
the coins of the latest Kshatrapa kings, the workmanship proving that
the two styles of coin are close in point of time. Thus taking the
Kshatrapa era to be the &#346;aka era the latest Kshatrapa date is 320
+ 78 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;398, which is just the date
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;399) of Chandragupta&rsquo;s
conquest of M√°lwa and Gujar√°t. For these reasons, and in
the absence of reasons to the contrary, it seems proper to take the
dates in Ushavad√°ta&rsquo;s and Ay√°ma&rsquo;s
inscriptions as in the era which began with Nahap√°na&rsquo;s
conquest of Gujar√°t, namely the &#346;aka era whose initial date
is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kshatrapa II. Chash&#7789;ana, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;130.</span>After Nahap√°na&rsquo;s the
earliest coins found in Gujar√°t are those of Chash&#7789;ana.
Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s coins are an adaptation of
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s coins. At the same time Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s
bust differs from the bust in Nahap√°na&rsquo;s coins. He wears a
mustache, the cap is not grooved but plain, and the hair which reaches
the neck is longer than Nahap√°na&rsquo;s hair. In one of
Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s coins found by Mr. Justice Newton, the hair
seems dressed in ringlets as in the coins of the Parthian king Phraates
II. (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;136&ndash;128).<a class="noteref" id="n29.3src" href="#n29.3" name="n29.3src">26</a> On the
reverse instead of the thunderbolt and arrow as in
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s coins, Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s coins have
symbols of the sun and moon in style much like the sun and moon symbols
on the Parthian coins of Phraates II., the moon being a crescent and
the sun represented by eleven rays shooting from a central beam. To the
two on the reverse a third symbol seems to have been added consisting
of two arches resting on a straight line, with a third arch over and

<p><span class="marginnote">Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s Coins, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;130.</span>The same symbol appears on the obverse
of several very old medium-sized square copper coins found in Upper
India. These coins Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l took to be coins of
A&#347;oka. They have no legend on either side, and have a standing
elephant on the obverse and a rampant lion on the reverse. As these are
the symbols of A&#347;oka, the elephant being found in his rock
inscriptions and the lion in his pillar inscriptions, Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l held them to be coins of A&#347;oka. The arch
symbol appears in these coins over the elephant on the obverse and near
the lion on the reverse but in neither case with the underlying zigzag
line.<a class="noteref" id="n30.2src" href="#n30.2" name="n30.2src">28</a> So also a contemporary coin bearing in the A&#347;oka

shows the same symbol, with in addition a robed male figure of good
design standing near the symbol saluting it with folded hands. The
position of the figure (Ariana Antiqua, Plate XV. Fig. 30) proves that
the symbol was an object of worship. In Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s coins
we find this symbol between the sun and the moon, a position which
suggests that the symbol represents the mythical mountain Meru, the
three semicircular superimposed arches representing the peaks of the
mountain and the crescent a <i>Siddha-&#347;il&acirc;</i> or
Siddhas&rsquo; seat, which Jaina works describe as crescent-shaped and
situated over Meru. The collective idea of this symbol in the middle
and the sun and moon on either side recalls the following;

the arch symbol with the Buddhist trident over it, the Bodhi tree with

Buddhist shrine with the Bodhi tree and the river Niranjana of Buddha

a different representation perhaps of the shrine of Mah√°bodhi at

Mah√°kshatrapa or great Kshatrapa. We know nothing of any

Though Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s coins and even the coins of his son and

era, of which the year 72 is given in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e5566" title="Source: Jun√°gad">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>
inscription of Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s grandson

Taking the previous period at seven years <span class="corr" id="xd25e5578" title="Source: Rudr√°man&rsquo;s">Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s</span>

they were father and son and the son it is supposed reigned for some
years with his father<a class="noteref" id="n32.2src" href="#n32.2"
name="n32.2src">35</a>) Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s conquest of
Gujar√°t comes to about the year 40 which makes <span class="corr" id="xd25e5585" title="Source: Chas&#7789;ana">Chash&#7789;ana</span> contemporary with the
latter part of Nahap√°na&rsquo;s life. Now the Tiastanes whom
Ptolemy mentions as having Ozene for his capital<a class="noteref" id="n32.3src" href="#n32.3" name="n32.3src">36</a> is on all hands
admitted to be Chash&#7789;ana and from what Ptolemy says it appears
certain that his capital was Ujjain. Two of Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s
coins occur as far north as Ajmir. As the Chash&#7789;ana coins in Dr.
Gerson DaCunha&rsquo;s collection were found in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a he must have ruled a large
stretch of country. The fact that in his earlier coins Chash&#7789;ana
is simply called a Kshatrapa and in his latter coins a
Mah√°kshatrapa leads to the inference that his power was
originally small. Chash&#7789;ana was probably not subordinate to
Nahap√°na but a contemporary of Nahap√°na originally when a
simple Kshatrapa governing perhaps North Gujar√°t and
M√°lwa. Nor was Chash&#7789;ana a member of
Nahap√°na&rsquo;s family as he is nowhere called
Kshahar√°ta which is the name of Nahap√°na&rsquo;s family.
During the lifetime of Nahap√°na Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s power
would seem to have been established first over Ajmir and <span class="corr" id="xd25e5591" title="Source: Mew√°d">Mew√°&#7693;</span>. Perhaps
Chash&#7789;ana may have been the chief of the Uttamabhadra Kshatriyas,
whom, in the year 42, Ushavad√°ta went to assist when they were
besieged by the M√°layas or M√°lavas<a class="noteref" id="n32.4src" href="#n32.4" name="n32.4src">37</a>; and it is possible
that the M√°lavas being thus driven away Chash&#7789;ana may have
consolidated his power, taken possession of M√°lwa, and
established his capital at Ujjain.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Deccan Recovered by the Andhras,

Chapter V.<br>
<span class="sc">Western Kshatrapas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;70&ndash;398.</span></span> conquests seem to
have been shortlived. Chash&#7789;ana appears to have eventually taken
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and as much of South
Gujar√°t as belonged to Nahap√°na probably as far south as
the Narbada. Mev√°&#7693;, M√°lwa, North and South
Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a would then be
subject to him and justify the title Mah√°kshatrapa on his later
coins.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Mevas or Me&#7693;as.</span>The bulk of
Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s army seems to have consisted of the Mevas or
Me&#7693;as from whose early conquests and settlements in Central
<span class="corr" id="xd25e5628" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span> the province
seems to have received its present name Mev√°&#7693;a. If this
supposition be correct an inference may be drawn regarding the origin
of Chash&#7789;ana. The Mathur√° inscription of
Nandasirik√°, daughter of Kshatrapa R√°javula and mother of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e5631" title="Source: Kh√°raosti">Kharaosti</span> Yuvar√°ja, mentions
with respect a Mah√°kshatrapa Kuzulko Patika who is called in the
inscription Mevaki that is of the Meva tribe. The inscription shows a
relation between the Kharaostis (to which tribe we have taken
Kshahar√°ta Nahap√°na to belong) and Mevaki Patika perhaps
in the nature of subordinate and overlord. It proves at least that the
Kharaostis held Patika in great honour and respect.</p>
<p>The Taxila plate shows that Patika was governor of Taxila during his
father&rsquo;s lifetime. After his father&rsquo;s death when he became
Mah√°kshatrapa, Patika&rsquo;s capital was Nagaraka in the
Jall√°l√°b√°d or K√°bul valley. The conquest of
those parts by the great Kush√°n or Indo-Skythian king Kanishka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78) seems to have driven
Patika&rsquo;s immediate successors southwards to Sindh where they may
have established a kingdom. The Skythian kingdom mentioned by the
author of the Periplus as stretching in his time as far south as the
mouths of the Indus may be a relic of this kingdom. Some time after
their establishment in Sindh Patika&rsquo;s successors may have sent
Chash&#7789;ana, either a younger member of the reigning house or a
military officer, with an army of Mevas through Umarkot and the Great
Ran to Central <span class="corr" id="xd25e5639" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span>, an
expedition which ended in the settlement of the Mevas and the change of
the country&rsquo;s name to Mev√°&#7693;a. Probably it was on
account of their previous ancestral connection that Nahap√°na
sent Ushavad√°ta to help Chash&#7789;ana in Mev√°&#7693;a
when besieged by his M√°lava neighbours. That Ushavad√°ta
went to bathe and make gifts<a class="noteref" id="n33.1src" href="#n33.1" name="n33.1src">38</a> at Pushkara proves that the scene of
the Uttamabhadras&rsquo; siege by the M√°layas was in
Mev√°&#7693;a not far from Pushkara.</p>
<p>Chash&#7789;ana is followed by an unbroken chain of successors all
of the dynasty of which Chash&#7789;ana was the founder. As the coins
of Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s successors bear dates and as each coin gives
the name of the king and of his father they supply a complete
chronological list of the Kshatrapa dynasty.</p>

the bull on the square hemidrachm&aelig; of Apollodotus (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;110&ndash;100). Round the bull within a dotted
circle is the legend in Greek. It is unfortunate the legend is
incomplete as the remaining letters which are in the Skythian-Greek

found. The letters that are preserved are <span class="sc">S T R X

<p>Though the name is not given in any of these coins, the fact that
Chash&#7789;ana was Jayad√°man&rsquo;s father has been determined
from the genealogy in the Gunda inscription of Rudrasim&#803;ha I. the

All these inscriptions and the coins of his son Rudrad√°man call
Jayad√°man Kshatrapa not Mah√°kshatrapa. This would seem to
show either that he was a Kshatrapa or governor of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a under his father or that his
father&rsquo;s territory and his rank as Mah√°kshatrapa suffered
some reduction.<a class="noteref" id="n34.5src" href="#n34.5" name="n34.5src">44</a> The extreme rarity of his coins suggests that
Jayad√°man&rsquo;s reign was very short. It is worthy of note
that while Zamotika and Chash&#7789;ana are foreign names, the names of

<p>None of Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s copper coins have been found.

<p>An inscription on the Girn√°r rock gives us more information
regarding Rudrad√°man than is available for any of the other
Kshatrapas. The inscription records the construction of a new dam on
the Sudar&#347;ana lake close to the inscription rock in place of a dam
built in the time of the Maurya king Chandragupta (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;300) and added to in the time of his grandson the
great <span class="corr" id="xd25e5837" title="Source: &Aacute;&#347;oka">A&#347;oka</span> (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;240) which had suddenly burst in a storm. The new
dam is recorded to have been made under the orders of Suvish√°kha
son of Kulaipa a Pahlava by tribe, who was &lsquo;appointed by the king
to protect the whole of &Aacute;narta and
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra.&rsquo; Pahlava seems to be the name of the
ancient Persians and Parthians<a class="noteref" id="n35.2src" href="#n35.2" name="n35.2src">47</a> and the name Suvish√°kha as Dr.
Bhau D√°ji suggests may be a Sanskritised form of
Sy√°vaxa.<a class="noteref" id="n35.3src" href="#n35.3" name="n35.3src">48</a> One of the K√°rle inscriptions gives a similar
name Sovasaka apparently a corrupt Indian form of the original Persian
from which the Sanskritised Suvish√°kha must have been formed.
Sovasaka it will be noted is mentioned in the K√°rle inscription
as an inhabitant of Abul√°m√°, apparently the old trade
mart of Obollah at the head of the Persian Gulf. This trade connection
between the Persian Gulf and the Western Indian seaboard must have led
to the settlement from very early times of the Pahlavas who gradually
became converted to Buddhism, and, like the <span class="corr" id="xd25e5852" title="Source: Parsis">P√°rsis</span> their modern
enterprising representatives, seem to have advanced in trade and
political influence. Subsequently the Pahlavas attained such influence
that about the fifth century a dynasty of Pallava kings reigned in the
Dekhan, Hindu in religion and name, even tracing their origin to the
great ancient sage Bh√°radv√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n35.4src" href="#n35.4" name="n35.4src">49</a></p>

Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s capital was not in Gujar√°t or
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Probably like his grandfather
Chash&#7789;ana Rudrad√°man held his capital at Ujjain. The
poetic eulogies of Rudrad√°man appear to contain a certain share
of fact. One of the epithets &lsquo;he who himself has earned the title

regained the title of Mah√°kshatrapa which belonged to his
grandfather Chash&#7789;ana but not to his father Jayad√°man.

two wars waged by Rudrad√°man, one with the Yaudheyas the other
with &#346;√°takar&#7751;i lord of Dakshin√°patha. Of the
Yaudheyas the inscription says that they had become arrogant and
untractable in consequence of their having proclaimed their assumption
of the title of Heroes among all Kshatriyas. Rudrad√°man is
described as having exterminated them. These Yaudheyas were known as a
warlike race from the earliest times and are mentioned as warriors by

<p>That the Girn√°r inscription describes Rudrad√°man as
the exterminator of &lsquo;the Yaudheyas&rsquo; and not of any king of
the Yaudheyas confirms the view that their constitution was tribal or
democratic.<a class="noteref" id="n37.3src" href="#n37.3" name="n37.3src">62</a></p>
<p>The style of the Yaudheya coins being an adaptation of the Kanishka
type and their being found from Mathur√° to Sah√°ranpur
where Kanishka ruled is a proof that the Yaudheyas wrested from the
successors of Kanishka the greater part of the North-West Provinces.
This is not to be understood to be the Yaudheyas&rsquo; first conquest
in India. They are known to be a very old tribe who after a temporary
suppression by Kanishka must have again risen to power with the decline
of Kush√°n rule under Kanishka&rsquo;s successors Huvishka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100&ndash;123) or Vasudeva
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;123&ndash;150&nbsp;?) the latter of
whom was a contemporary of Rudrad√°man.<a class="noteref" id="n37.4src" href="#n37.4" name="n37.4src">63</a> It is probably to this
increase of Yaudheya power that Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s inscription
refers as making them arrogant and intractable. Their forcible
extermination is not to be understood literally but in the Indian
hyperbolic fashion.</p>

Chash&#7789;ana and Pulum√°yi were contemporary kings reigning at
Ujjain and Paithan. The evidence of their coins also shows that if not
contemporaries Chash&#7789;ana and Pulum√°yi were not separated

the <span class="corr" id="xd25e6095" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span> that

to the view that Chash&#7789;ana, who was the next Kshatrapa after
Nahap√°na, and Pulum√°yi, who was the successor of
Gautam&iacute;putra, were contemporaries. We have no positive evidence
to determine who was the immediate successor of Pulum√°yi, but
the only king whose inscriptions are found in any number after

gives the name of the father of Yaj&ntilde;a&#347;r&iacute;.
Unfortunately the coin is much worn. Still the remains of the letters

almost coeval with those in Pulum√°yi&rsquo;s inscriptions. The
facts that he was called V√°sish&#7789;h&iacute;putra and that he

Yaj&ntilde;a&#347;r&iacute; would thus be the nephew and second in
succession to Pulum√°yi and the contemporary of Rudrad√°man
the grandson of Chash&#7789;ana, whom we have taken to be a
contemporary of Pulum√°yi. A further proof of this is afforded by
Yaj&ntilde;a&#347;r&iacute;&rsquo;s silver coin found in the

is said &lsquo;to have gained great fame by studying to the end, by
remembering understanding and applying the great sciences such as
grammar, polity, music, and logic&rsquo;. Another epithet describes him
as having &lsquo;obtained numerous garlands at the Svayamvaras of
kings&rsquo; daughters,&rsquo; apparently meaning that he was chosen as
husband by princesses at several <i>svayamvaras</i> or choice-marriages
a practice which seems to have been still in vogue in
Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s time. As a test of the civilized character of
his rule it may be noted that he is described as &lsquo;he who took,
and kept to the end of his life, the vow to stop killing men except in
battle.&rsquo; Another epithet tells us that the embankment was built
and the lake reconstructed by &lsquo;expending a great amount of money
from his own treasury, without oppressing the people of the town and of
the province by (exacting) taxes, forced labour, acts of affection
(benevolences) and the like.&rsquo;</p>

Girn√°r inscription gives 72 as the year in which
Rudrad√°man was then reigning and it is fair to suppose that he

D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute; is not called a
Mah√°kshatrapa but simply a Kshatrapa. His coins are very rare.
The six mentioned are the only specimens known and are all from one
find. He may therefore be supposed to have reigned as heir-apparent
during the life-time of Rudrad√°man, or it is possible that he
may have suffered loss of territory and power. His reign seems to have
been short and may have terminated about 90 that is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;168 or a little later.</p>

<p>Coin C though struck from a different die is closely like B both on
the obverse and the reverse. Neither the Greek legend nor the date is

suggest the date 118. Coin D is in obverse closely like C. The date 118
is clear. On the reverse the legend and the symbols have been twice

obliterated the last letters of the legend which contained the name of
the king whose coin it is:</p>

<p>In these four specimens D√°ma&#347;r&iacute; or
D√°m√°ja&#7693;a is styled Mah√°kshatrapa, while in
his own coins he is simply called Kshatrapa. The explanation perhaps is
that the known coins of D√°ma&#347;r&iacute; or
D√°maja&#7693;a belong to the early part of his reign when he was
subordinate to his father, and that he afterwards gained the title of
Mah√°kshatrapa. Some such explanation is necessary as the
distinction between the titles Kshatrapa and Mah√°kshatrapa is
always carefully preserved in the earlier Kshatrapa coins. Except
towards the close of the dynasty no ruler called Kshatrapa on his own
coins is ever styled Mah√°kshatrapa on the coins of his son
unless the father gained the more important title during his
lifetime.</p>
<p>The dates and the difference in the style of die used in coining A
and in coining B, C, and D are worth noting as the earliest coin has
the date 100 and C and D the third and fourth coins have 118. If
Jivad√°man&rsquo;s reign lasted eighteen years his coins would be
common instead of very rare. But we find between 102 and 118 numerous
coins of Rudrasim&#803;ha son of Rudrad√°man and paternal uncle
of Jivad√°man. These facts and the difference between the style
of A and the style of B, C, and D which are apparently imitated from
the coins of Rudrasim&#803;ha and have a face much older than the face
in A, tend to show that soon after his accession Jivad√°man was
deposed by his uncle Rudrasim&#803;ha, on whose death or defeat in 118,
Jivad√°man again rose to power.</p>

earliest year is 103 and the latest 118 it is probable that
Rudrasim&#803;ha deposed his nephew Jivad√°man shortly after
Jivad√°man&rsquo;s accession. Rudrasim&#803;ha appears to have
ruled fifteen years when power again passed to his nephew

<p>Rudrasim&#803;ha had also a copper coinage of which specimens are

had one specimen from Ujjain which has a bull on the obverse with the
Greek legend round it and the date 117. The reverse seems to have held
the entire legend of which only five letters <span lang="sa">&#2352;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2367;&#2306;&#2361;&#2360;</span>

<p>To Rudrasim&#803;ha&rsquo;s reign belongs the Gunda inscription
carved on a stone found at the bottom of an unused well in the village
of Gunda in <span class="corr" id="xd25e6450" title="Source: Hal√°r">H√°l√°r</span> in North

href="#n42.1" name="n42.1src">75</a> It is in six well preserved lines
of old N√°gar&iacute; letters of the Kshatrapa type. The writing
records the digging and building of a well for public use on the
borders of a village named Rasopadra by the commander-in-chief
Rudrabh&uacute;ti an &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra son of Sen√°pati
B√°paka. The date is given both in words and in numerals as 103,
&lsquo;in the year&rsquo; of the king the Kshatrapa Sv√°mi
Rudrasim&#803;ha, apparently meaning in the year 103 during the reign
of Rudrasim&#803;ha. The genealogy given in the inscription is: 1
Chash&#7789;ana; 2 Jayad√°man; 3 Rudrad√°man; 4
Rudrasim&#803;ha, the order of succession being clearly defined by the
text, which says that the fourth was the great grandson of the first,
the grandson of the second, and the son of the third. It will be noted

id="xd25e6468" title="Source: J&iacute;vad√°m√°n">Jivad√°man</span> the
fifth and sixth Kshatrapas have been passed over in this genealogy
probably because the inscription did not intend to give a complete
genealogy but only to show the descent of Rudrasim&#803;ha in the
direct line.</p>

<p>After D√°masena we find coins of three of his sons
V&iacute;rad√°man Ya&#347;ad√°man and Vijayasena.
V&iacute;rad√°man&rsquo;s coins are dated 158 and 163,
Ya&#347;ad√°man&rsquo;s 160 and 161, and Vijayasena&rsquo;s
earliest 160. Of the three brothers V&iacute;rad√°man who is
styled simply Kshatrapa probably held only a part of his father&rsquo;s
dominions. The second brother Ya&#347;ad√°man, who at first was a
simple Kshatrapa, in 161 claims to be Mah√°kshatrapa. The third
brother Vijayasena, who as early as 160, is styled
Mah√°kshatrapa, probably defeated Ya&#347;ad√°man and
secured the supreme rule.</p>

latest coins of his predecessor. The earliest coins of his son and
successor Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha are dated 198. As
Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha&rsquo;s coins are of bad workmanship with
doubtful legend and date we may take the end of Rudrasena II.&rsquo;s
reign to be somewhere between 190 and 198 or about 194. This date would
give Rudrasena a reign of about sixteen years, a length of rule
supported by the large number of his coins. The legend reads:</p>

<p>It is not known whether Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha&rsquo;s loss of title
was due to his being subordinate to some overlord, or whether during
his reign the Kshatrapas suffered defeat and loss of territory. The
probable explanation seems to be that he began his reign in a
subordinate position and afterwards rose to supreme rule.</p>

Bhartt&#7771;id√°man&rsquo;s reign seems to have lasted about
fourteen years from 202 to 216 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;278&ndash;294). Most of the coin legends style
Bhartt&#7771;id√°man Mah√°kshatrapa though in a few he is

<p>It would seem from the lower title of Kshatrapa which we find given

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249), his brother
D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute; III. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;251&ndash;255), Rudrasena II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;256&ndash;272) son of V&iacute;rad√°man,

the hoard furnish evidence of the local rule of the kings whose coins
have been found at Kar√°d. The date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249) of Vijayasena, the earliest king
of the hoard, agrees well with the spread of Gujar√°t power in
the Dakhan as it follows the overthrow both of the west (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;180&ndash;200) and of the east (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;220) <span class="corr" id="xd25e7118" title="Source: &#346;√°&#7789;akarnis">&#346;√°takar&#7751;is</span>,
while it precedes the establishment of any later west Dakhan dynasty:
(2) All the kings whose coins occur in the hoard were
Mah√°kshatrapas and from the details in the Periplus
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247), the earliest, Vijayasena, must
have been a ruler of special wealth and power: (3) That the coins cease
with Vi&#347;vasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;296&ndash;300)
is in accord with the fact that Vi&#347;vasena was the last of the
direct line of Chash&#7789;ana, and that with or before the close of
Vi&#347;vasena&rsquo;s reign the power of the Gujar√°t Kshatrapas
declined. The presumption that Kshatrapa power was at its height during
the reigns of the kings whose coins have been found at Kar√°d is
strengthened by the discovery at Amr√°vati in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e7128" title="Source: Berars">Ber√°rs</span> of a

of Chash&#7789;ana&rsquo;s direct line was due to their conquest by
some other dynasty or to the failure of heirs is doubtful. Whatever may
have been the cause, after an interval of about seven years
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300&ndash;308) an entirely new king
appears, Rudrasim&#803;ha son of J&iacute;vad√°man. As
Rudrasim&#803;ha&rsquo;s father J&iacute;vad√°man is simply
called Sv√°mi he may have been some high officer under the
Kshatrapa dynasty. That Rudrasim&#803;ha is called a Kshatrapa may show
that part of the Kshatrapa dominion which had been lost during the
reign of Vi&#347;vasena was given to some distant member or scion of
the Kshatrapa dynasty of the name of Rudrasim&#803;ha. The occurrence
of political changes is further shown by the fact that the coins of
Rudrasim&#803;ha are of a better type than those of the preceding
Kshatrapas. Rudrasim&#803;ha&rsquo;s coins are fairly common. Of twelve
in Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s collection five are clearly
dated, three 230, one 231, and one 240. This leaves a blank of seven
years between the last date of Vi&#347;vasena and the earliest date of
Rudrasim&#803;ha. The legend reads:</p>

Ya&#347;ad√°man&rsquo;s are those of D√°masiri who was
probably the brother of Ya&#347;ad√°man as he is mentioned as the
son of Rudrasim&#803;ha. The date though not very clear is apparently
242. Only one coin of D√°masiri&rsquo;s is recorded. In the style
of face and in the form of letters it differs from the coins of
Ya&#347;ad√°man, with which except for the date and the identity
of the father&rsquo;s name any close connection would seem doubtful.
The legend on the coin of D√°masiri reads:</p>

great Kshatrapa Rudrasim&#803;ha.</p>
</div>
<p>It will be noted that in this coin both Rudrasim&#803;ha and
D√°masiri are called great Kshatrapas, while in his own coin and
in the coins of his son Ya&#347;ad√°man, Rudrasim&#803;ha is
simply styled Kshatrapa. It is possible that D√°masiri may have
been more powerful than Ya&#347;ad√°man and consequently taken to
himself the title of Mah√°kshatrapa. The application of the more
important title to a father who in life had not enjoyed the title is
not an uncommon practice among the later Kshatrapas. The rarity of
D√°masiri&rsquo;s coins shows that his reign was short.</p>
<p>After D√°masiri comes a blank of about thirty years. The next
coin is dated 270. The fact that, contrary to what might have been
expected, the coins of the later Kshatrapas are less common than those
of the earlier Kshatrapas, seems to point to some great political
change during the twenty-seven years ending 270 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;321&ndash;348).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kshatrapa XXIV. Rudrasena, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;348&ndash;376.</span>The coin dated 270 belongs
to Sv√°mi Rudrasena son of Sv√°mi Rudrad√°man both of
whom the legend styles Mah√°kshatrapas. The type of the coin
dated 270 is clearly adapted from the type of the coins of
Ya&#347;ad√°man. Only two of Rudrasena&rsquo;s coins dated 270
are recorded. But later coins of the same Kshatrapa of a different
style are found in large numbers. Of fifty-four in the Pandit&rsquo;s
collection, twelve have the following dates 288, 290, 292, 293, 294,
296, and 298. The difference in the style of the two sets of coins and
the blank between 270 and 288 leave no doubt that during those years
some political change took place. Probably Rudrasena was for a time
overthrown but again came to power in 288 and maintained his position
till 298. Besides calling both himself and his father
Mah√°kshatrapas Rudrasena adds to both the attribute
Sv√°mi. As no coin of Rudrasena&rsquo;s father is recorded it
seems probable the father was not an independent ruler and that the
legend on Rudrasena&rsquo;s coins is a further instance of a son
ennobling his father. The legend is the same both in the earlier coins
of 270 and in the later coins ranging from 288 to 298. It reads:</p>

<p>Of Rudrasena&rsquo;s father Satyasena no coin is recorded and as
this Rudrasena immediately succeeds Rudrasena IV. son of
Rudrad√°man, there is little doubt that Satyasena was not an
actual ruler with the great title Mah√°kshatrapa, but that this
was an honorific title given to the father when his son attained to
sovereignty. General Cunningham records that a coin of this Rudrasena
IV. was found along with a coin of Chandragupta II. in a
<i>st&uacute;pa</i> at Sult√°nganj on the Ganges about fifteen

<p><span class="marginnote">Kshatrapa XXVI. Sim&#803;hasena.</span>With
Rudrasena IV. the evidence from coins comes almost to a close. Only one
coin in Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s collection is clearly
later than Rudrasena IV. In the form of the bust and the style of the
legend on the reverse this specimen closely resembles the coins of
Rudrasena IV. Unfortunately owing to imperfect stamping it bears no
date. The legend reads:</p>

<p>This legend would seem to show that Rudrasena IV. left no issue and
was succeeded by his nephew Sim&#803;hasena. The extreme rarity of
Sim&#803;hasena&rsquo;s coins proves that his reign was very short.</p>

&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s coins closely resemble those of the
fifteenth Kshatrapa Vijayasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249). At the same time the text of the
N√°gar&iacute; legend differs from that on the reverse of the
Kshatrapa coins by omitting the name of the ruler&rsquo;s father and by
showing in words &Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s date in the year of
his own reign. The legend is:</p>
<div class="q xd25e5034">

<p>In the first year of the king the great Kshatrapa
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta.</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the recorded coins of &Iacute;&#347;varadatta have this
legend. In one specimen the legend is</p>
<div class="q xd25e5034">
<p class="first"><span lang="sa">&#2357;&#2352;&#2381;&#2359;&#2375;

<p lang="sa-latn">Varshe dvit&iacute;ye.</p>
<p>In the second year.</p>
</div>
<p>It is clear from this that &Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s reign did
not last long. His peculiar name and his separate date leave little
doubt that he belonged to some distinct family of Kshatrapas. The
general style of his coins shows that he cannot have been a late
Kshatrapa while the fact that he is called Mah√°kshatrapa seems
to show he was an independent ruler. No good evidence is available for
fixing his date. As already mentioned the workmanship of his coins
brings him near to Vijayasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249). In N√°sik Cave X. the
letters of Inscription XV. closely correspond with the letters of the
legends on Kshatrapa coins, and probably belong to almost the same date
as the inscription of <span class="corr" id="xd25e7382" title="Source: Rudr√°daman">Rudrad√°man</span> on the
Girn√°r rock that is to about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150. The absence of any record of the
&Aacute;ndhras except the name of the king Madhar&iacute;puta Sirisena
or Sakasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;180), makes it probable
that after Yaj&ntilde;a&#347;r&iacute; Gautam&iacute;putra
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) &Aacute;ndhra power waned along
the Konkan and South Gujar√°t seaboard. According to the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e7395" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span> the
&Aacute;bh&iacute;ras succeeded to the dominion of the &Aacute;ndhras.
It is therefore possible that the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra king
&Iacute;&#347;varasena of N√°sik Inscription XV. was one of the
&Aacute;bh&iacute;ra conquerors of the &Aacute;ndhras who took from
them the West Dakhan. A migration of &Aacute;bh&iacute;ras from
Ptolemy&rsquo;s Abiria in Upper Sindh through Sindh by sea to the
Konkan and thence to N√°sik is within the range of possibility.
About fifty years later king &Iacute;&#347;varadatta<a class="noteref"
id="n52.1src" href="#n52.1" name="n52.1src">92</a> who was perhaps of
the same family as the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra king of the N√°sik
inscription seems to have conquered the kingdom of Kshatrapa
Vijayasena, adding Gujar√°t,
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, and part of the Dakhan to his
other territory. In honour of this great conquest he may have taken the
title Mah√°kshatrapa and struck coins in the Gujar√°t
Kshatrapa style but in an era reckoned from the date of his own
conquest. &Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s success was shortlived. Only
two years later (that is about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;252)
the Mah√°kshatrapa <span class="corr" id="xd25e7407" title="Source: D√°m√°ja&#7693;asr&iacute;">D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute;</span>
won back the lost Kshatrapa territory. The fact that
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s recorded coins belong to only two years
and that the break between the regular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

A. S.</abbr> IX. 1&ndash;19) as the Sah or S&acirc;h kings. More
recently, from the fact that the names of some of them end in Sena or
army, the Kshatrapas have been called the Sena kings. The origin of the
title Sah is the ending <i>siha</i>, that is <i>sim&#803;ha</i> lion,
which belongs to the names of several of the kings. <i>S&iacute;ha</i>
has been read either <i>s√°h</i> or <i>sena</i> because of the
practice of omitting from the die vowels which would fall on or above
the top line of the legend and also of omitting the short vowel
<i>i</i> with the following <i>anusv√°ra</i>. S√°h is
therefore a true reading of the writing on certain of the coins. That
the form S√°h on these coins is not the correct form has been
ascertained from stone inscriptions in which freedom from crowding
makes possible the complete cutting of the above-line marks. In stone
inscriptions the ending is <i>s&iacute;ha</i> lion. See Fleet&rsquo;s
<span lang="la">Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum</span>, III. 36 note 1.
Mr. Fleet (Ditto) seems to suggest that with the proof of the
incorrectness of the reading S√°h the evidence that the
Kshatrapas were of Indo-Skythian origin ceases. This does not seem to
follow. In addition to the Parthian title Kshatrapa, their northern
coinage, and the use of the &#346;aka (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78) era, now accepted as the accession of the
great Kush√°n Kanishka, the evidence in the text shows that the
line of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Kshatrapas starts from
the foreigner Chash&#7789;ana (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;130)
whose predecessor Nah√°pana (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;120) and his &#346;aka son-in-law Ushavadatta are
noted in N√°sik inscriptions (N√°sik Gazetteer, 538 and
621) as leaders of &#346;akas, Palhavas, and Yavanas. Further as the
limits of Ptolemy&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150)
Indo-Skythia (McCrindle, 136) agree very closely with the limits of the
dominions of the then ruling Mah√°kshatrapa Rudrad√°man
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) it follows that Ptolemy or his
informer believed Rudrad√°man to be an Indo-Skythian. There
therefore seems no reasonable doubt that the Kshatrapas were
foreigners. According to Cunningham (Num. Chron. VIII. 231) they were
&#346;akas who entered Gujar√°t from Sindh. The fact that the
Kush√°n era (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78) was not
adopted by the first two of the Western Kshatrapas, Chash&#7789;ana and
Jayad√°man, supports the view that they belonged to a wave of
northerners earlier than the Kush√°n wave.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n20.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n21.7"
href="#n21.7src" name="n21.7">8</a></span> The explanation of the word
Kshatrapa started by Prinsep and accepted by Pandit
Bhagv√°nl√°l is of doubtful accuracy. The title is well
known in Greek literature in the form <span class="trans" title="satrap&#275;s"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&sigma;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&eta;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
and in the form Kshatrap√°van occurs twice (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;520) in connection with the governors of Baktria
and Arachosia in the great Behistan inscription of Darius
(Rawlinson&rsquo;s Herodotus, I. 329; Spiegel&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Altpersische Keilinschriften</span>, 24&ndash;26). The meaning of
Kshatrap√°van in old Persian is not &ldquo;protector of the
Kshatra race&rdquo; but &ldquo;protector of the kingdom,&rdquo; for the
word <i>kshatram</i> occurs in the inscriptions of the
Ach&aelig;menid&aelig; with the meaning of &ldquo;kingship&rdquo; or
&ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; (Spiegel, <span lang="de">Altpersische
Keilinschriften</span>, 215). As is well known Satrap was the official
title of the ruler of a Persian province. That the name continued in
use with the same meaning under the Greek kings of Baktria
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;250&ndash;100) is known from Strabo,
who says (XI. 11) &ldquo;the Greeks who held Baktria divided it into
satrapies (<span class="trans" title="satrapeias"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&sigma;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span></span>)
of which Aspionus and Touriva were taken from Eukratides (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180) by the Parthians.&rdquo; It is to be
presumed that the Baktro-Grecians introduced the same arrangement into
the provinces which they conquered in India. The earliest occurrence of
the title in its Indian form is on the coins of a Rajabula or Ranjabola
(Gardner, B. M. Cat. 67), who in his Greek legend makes use of the
title &ldquo;King of kings,&rdquo; and in his Indian legend calls
himself &ldquo;The unconquered Chhatrapa.&rdquo; His adoption for the
reverse of his coins of the Athene Promachos type of Menander and
Apollodotus Philopator connects Rajabula in time with those kings
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;126&ndash;100) and we know from an
inscription (Cunningham Arch. Rep. XX. 48) that he reigned at
Mathur√°. He was probably a provincial governor who became
independent about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;100 when the Greek
kingdom broke up. The above facts go to show that Kshatrapa was
originally a Persian title which was adopted by the Greeks and
continued in use among their successors: that it originally denoted a
provincial governor; but that, when the Greek kingdom broke up and
their provincial chiefs became independent, it continued in use as a
royal title. That after the Christian era, even in Parthia, the title
Satrapes does not necessarily imply subjection to a suzerain is proved
by the use of the phrase <span class="trans" title="satrap&#275;s t&#333;n satrap&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&sigma;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&eta;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega;&nu;

<p class="footnote cont">The Pandit&rsquo;s identification of the
Malavas or Malayas with a northern or Skythian tribe is in agreement
with Alberuni (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1015), who, on the
authority of the B√°j Pur√°na (Sachau&rsquo;s Text,
<abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 29 page 150&ndash;155) groups as
northern tribes the Pallavas, &#346;akas, Mallas, and Gurjars. In spite
of this authority it seems better to identify the Mallas, Malavas, or
Malayas with Alexander the Great&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;325) Malloi of <span class="corr" id="xd25e4866"

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n27.2"
href="#n27.2src" name="n27.2">17</a></span> The author&rsquo;s only
reason for supposing that two eras began between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;70 and 80 seems to be the fact that the Javanese
&#346;aka era begins <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74, while the
Indian &#346;aka era begins <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78. It
appears, however, from Lassen&rsquo;s Ind. Alt. II. 1040 note 1, that
the Javanese &#346;aka era begins either in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74 or in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78.
The author&rsquo;s own authority, Dr. Burnell (<abbr>S. Ind.
Pal.</abbr> 72) while saying that the Javanese &#346;aka era dates from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74, gives <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;80 as the epoch of the &#346;aka era of the
neighbouring island of Bali, thus supporting Raffle&rsquo;s explanation
(Java, II. 68) that the difference is due to the introduction into Java
of the Muhammadan mode of reckoning during the past 300 years. The
Javanese epoch of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;74 cannot therefore
be treated as an authority for assuming a genuine Indian era with this
initial date. The era of Kanishka was used continuously down to its
year 281 (Fergusson Hist. of Ind. Architecture, 740) and after that
date we have numerous instances of the use of the
&#346;akan&#7771;ipak√°la or &#346;akak√°la down to the
familiar &#346;aka of the present day. It seems much more likely that
the parent of the modern &#346;aka era was that of Kanishka, which
remained in use for nearly three centuries, than that of
Nahap√°na, who so far as we know left no son, and whose era (if
he founded one) probably expired when the Kshahar√°ta power was
destroyed by the <span class="corr" id="xd25e5213" title="Source: Andhrabh&#7771;ityas">&Aacute;ndhrabh&#7771;ityas</span> in
the first half of the second century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> We
must therefore assume <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 to be the
epoch of Kanishka&rsquo;s era. There remains the question whether
Nahap√°na dates by Kanishka&rsquo;s era, or uses his own regnal
years. There is nothing improbable in the latter supposition, and we
are not forced to suppose that Nahap√°na was a feudatory of the
Kush√°n kings. It has been shown above that the use of the title
Kshatrapa does not necessarily imply a relation of inferiority. On the
other hand (<i>pace</i> Oldenburg in <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> X. 213) the later Kshatrapas
certainly seem to have used Kanishka&rsquo;s era: and Nahap√°na
and the Kush√°n dynasty seem to have been of the same race: for
Heraus, who was certainly a Kush√°n, apparently calls himself
&#346;aka on his coins (Gardner B. M. Cat. xlvii.)<span class="corr"
id="xd25e5229" title="Source: :">;</span> and it is highly probable
that Nahap√°na, like his son-in-law Ushavad√°ta, was a
&#346;aka. Further, the fact that Nahap√°na does not call himself
Mah√°r√°ja but R√°ja goes to show that he was not a
paramount sovereign.&mdash;(A. M. T. J.)&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n27.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

Rudrasim&#803;ha, which has <span lang="sa">&#2352;&#2370;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2367;&#2306;&#2361;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;

that is in the hundred and third year of Rudrasim&#803;ha. Clearly a
regnal year cannot be meant as no reign could last over 103 years. So
with the year 72 in Rudrad√°man&rsquo;s inscription. The same
style of writing appears in the inscriptions at Mathur√° of
Huvishka and Vasudeva which say &lsquo;year &mdash;&mdash; of
Huvishka&rsquo; and &lsquo;year &mdash;&mdash; of Vasudeva&rsquo;
though it is known that the era is of Kanishka. In all these cases what
is meant is &lsquo;the dynastic or era year &mdash;&mdash; in the reign

the Pandit&rsquo;s estimate of fifteen years might not with advantage
be increased. As his father&rsquo;s reign was so short
Rudrad√°man probably succeeded when still young. The abundance of
his coins points to a long reign and the scarcity of the coins both of
his son D√°m√°za&#7693;a and of his grandson
J&iacute;vad√°man imply that neither of his successors reigned
more than a few years. Jivad√°man&rsquo;s earliest date is

reign would be <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;173 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 95) that is a reign of thirty years, no

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;225 suggest that
San&#775;ghad√°man (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;222&ndash;226) may be the Sandanes whom the
Periplus (McCrindle, 128) describes as taking the regular mart
Kaly√°n near Bombay from Saraganes, that is the Dakhan
<span class="corr" id="xd25e6639" title="Source: &#346;√°takarnis">&#346;√°takar&#7751;is</span>,
and, to prevent it again becoming a place of trade, forbidding all
Greek ships to visit Kaly√°n, and sending under a guard to Broach
any Greek ships that even by accident entered its port. The following
reasons seem conclusive against identifying San&#775;ghad√°man
with Sandanes: (1) The abbreviation from San&#775;ghad√°man to
Sandanes seems excessive in the case of the name of a well known ruler
who lived within thirty years of the probable time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247) when the writer of the Periplus visited
Gujar√°t and the Konkan: (2) The date of San&#775;ghad√°man
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;222&ndash;226) is twenty to thirty
years too early for the probable collection of the Periplus details:
(3) Apart from the date of the Periplus the apparent distinction in the
writer&rsquo;s mind between Sandanes&rsquo; capture of Kaly√°n
and his own time implies a longer lapse than suits a reign of only four
years.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In favour of the Sandanes of the Periplus
being a dynastic not a personal name is its close correspondence both
in form and in geographical position with Ptolemy&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) Sadaneis, who gave their name, Ariake
Sadin&ocirc;n or the Sadins&rsquo; Aria, to the North Konkan, and,
according to McCrindle (Ptolemy, 39) in the time of Ptolemy ruled the
prosperous trading communities that occupied the sea coast to about
Semulla or Chaul. The details in the present text show that some few
years before Ptolemy wrote the conquests of Rudrad√°man had
brought the North Konkan under the Gujar√°t <span class="corr"
id="xd25e6653" title="Source: Kshatrap√°s">Kshatrapas</span>.
Similarly shortly before the probable date of the Periplus
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247) the fact that
San&#775;ghad√°man and his successors D√°masena
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;226&ndash;236) and Vijayasena
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249) all used the title
Mah√°kshatrapa makes their possession of the North Konkan
probable. The available details of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Kshatrapas therefore confirm the
view that the Sadans of Ptolemy and the Sandanes of the Periplus are
the Gujar√°t Kshatrapas. The question remains how did the Greeks
come to know the Kshatrapas by the name of Sadan or Sandan. The answer
seems to be the word Sadan or Sandan is the Sanskrit
<i>S√°dhana</i> which according to Lassen (McCrindle&rsquo;s
Ptolemy, 40) and Williams&rsquo; Sanskrit Dictionary may mean agent or
representative and may therefore be an accurate rendering of Kshatrapa
in the sense of Viceroy. Wilford (<abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As.
Res.</abbr> IX. 76, 198) notices that Sanskrit writers give the early
English in India the title S√°dhan Engrez. This Wilford would
translate Lord but it seems rather meant for a rendering of the word
Factor. Prof. <span class="corr" id="xd25e6672" title="Source: Bh√°nd√°rkar">Bhand√°rkar</span>
(<abbr title="Bombay Gazetteer">Bom. Gaz.</abbr> XIII. 418 note 1)
notices a tribe mentioned by the geographer Var√°hamihira
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580) as &#346;√°ntikas and
associated with the Apar√°ntakas or people of the west coast. He
shows how according to the rules of letter changes the Sanskrit
&#346;√°ntika would in Pr√°krit be S√°ndino. In his
opinion it was this form Sandino which was familiar to Greek merchants
and sailors. Prof. Bhand√°rkar holds that when (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;100&ndash;110) the Kshatrapa Nahap√°na
displaced the &#346;√°tav√°hanas or
&Aacute;ndhrabh&#7771;ityas the &#346;√°ntikas or Sandino became
independent in the North Konkan and took Kaly√°n. To make their
independence secure against the Kshatrapas they forbad intercourse
between their own territory and the Dakhan and sent foreign ships to
Barygaza. Against this explanation it is to be urged; (1) That
N√°sik and Junnar inscriptions show Nahap√°na supreme in
the North Konkan at least up to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;120;
(2) That according to the Periplus the action taken by the Sandans or
Sadans was not against the Kshatrapas but against the <span class="corr" id="xd25e6688" title="Source: &#346;√°takarnis">&#346;√°takar&#7751;is</span>;
(3) That the action was not taken in the time of Nahap√°na but at
a later time, later not only than the first Gautam&iacute;putra the
conqueror of Nahap√°na or his son-in-law Ushavad√°ta
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;138), but later than the second
Gautam&iacute;putra, who was defeated by the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Kshatrapa Rudrad√°man some
time before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150; (4) That if the
&#346;√°ntikas were solely a North Konkan tribe they would
neither wish nor be able to send foreign ships to Broach. The action
described in the Periplus of refusing to let Greek ships enter
Kaly√°n and of sending all such ships to Broach was the action of
a Gujar√°t conqueror of Kaly√°n determined to make foreign
trade centre in his own chief emporium Broach. The only possible lord
of Gujar√°t either in the second or third century who can have
adopted such a policy was the Kshatrapa of Ujjain in M√°lwa and
of Minnagara or <span class="corr" id="xd25e6699" title="Source: Junaga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span> in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, the same ruler, who, to
encourage foreign vessels to visit Broach had (McCrindle&rsquo;s
Periplus, 118, 119) stationed native fishermen with well-manned long
boats off the south K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a coast to meet
ships and pilot them through the tidal and other dangers up the Narbada
to Broach. It follows that the Sandanes of the Periplus and
Ptolemy&rsquo;s North Konkan S√°dans are the Gujar√°t
Mah√°kshatrapas. The correctness of this identification of Sadan
with the Sanskrit S√°dhan and the explanation of S√°dhan as
a translation of Kshatrapa or representative receive confirmation from
the fact that the account of K√°lak√°ch√°rya in the
Bharahe&#347;wara V&#7771;&iacute;tti (<abbr title="Journal Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society">J. B. B. R. A. S.</abbr>
IX. 141&ndash;142), late in date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1000&ndash;1100) but with notable details of the
&#346;aka or &#346;√°hi invaders, calls the &#346;aka king
S√°dhana-Sim&#803;ha. If on this evidence it may be held that the
Kshatrapas were known as S√°dhanas, it seems to follow that
&#346;√°ntika the form used by Var√°hamihira (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;505&ndash;587) is a conscious and intentional
Sanskritizing of S√°dan whose correct form and origin had passed
out of knowledge, a result which would suggest conscious or artificial
Sanskritizing as the explanation of the forms of many <span class="corr" id="xd25e6712" title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> tribal and place
names. A further important result of this inquiry is to show that the
received date of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;70 for the Periplus
cannot stand. Now that the Kanishka era <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 is admitted to be the era used by the
Kshatrapas both in the Dakhan and in Gujar√°t it follows that a
writer who knows the elder and the younger <span class="corr" id="xd25e6722" title="Source: &#346;√°takarnis">&#346;√°takar&#7751;is</span>
cannot be earlier than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150 and from
the manner in which he refers to them must almost certainly be
considerably later. This conclusion supports the date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247 which on other weighty grounds the French
scholar Reinaud (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> Dec.
1879. pp. 330, 338) has assigned to the Periplus.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n44.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n53.1"
href="#n53.1src" name="n53.1">93</a></span> Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s suggestion that Vijayasena
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;238&ndash;249) was defeated by the
&Aacute;bh&iacute;r or Ah&iacute;r king &Iacute;&#347;varadatta who
entered Gujar√°t from the North Konkan seems open to question.
First as regards the suggestion that Vijayasena was the Kshatrapa whose
power &Iacute;&#347;varadatta overthrew it is to be noticed that though
the two coinless years (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;249&ndash;251) between the last coin of
Vijayasena and the earliest coin of
D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute; agree with the recorded
length of &Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s supremacy the absence of
coins is not in itself proof of a reverse or loss of Kshatrapa power
between the reigns of Vijayasena and <span class="corr" id="xd25e7433"
title="Source: D√°m√°jada&#347;r&iacute;">D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute;</span>.
It is true the Pandit considers that &Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s
coins closely resemble those of Vijayasena. At the same time he also
(N√°sik Stat. Acct. 624) thought them very similar to
V&iacute;rad√°man&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;236&ndash;238) coins.
V&iacute;rad√°man&rsquo;s date so immediately precedes
Vijayasena&rsquo;s that in many respects their coins must be closely
alike. It is to be noted that <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;230&ndash;235 the time of rival Kshatrapas among
whom V&iacute;rad√°man was one (especially the time between
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;236 and 238 during which none of the
rivals assumed the title Mah√°kshatrapa) was suitable to (perhaps
was the result of) a successful invasion by &Iacute;&#347;varadatta,
and that this same invasion may have been the cause of the transfer of
the capital, noted in the Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247) as having taken place some years before,
from Ozene or Ujjain to Minnagara or <span class="corr" id="xd25e7449"
title="Source: Jun√°gadh">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>
(McCrindle, 114, 122). On the other hand the fact that Vijayasena
regained the title of Mah√°kshatrapa and handed it to his
successor D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute; III. would seem
to shew that no reverse or humiliation occurred during the coinless
years (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;249&ndash;251) between their
reigns, a supposition which is supported by the flourishing state of
the kingdom at the time of the Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247) and also by the evidence that both the above
Kshatrapas ruled near Kar√°d in S√°t√°ra. At the same
time if the difference <span class="corr" id="xd25e7458" title="Source: betweed">between</span> V&iacute;rad√°man&rsquo;s and
Vijayasena&rsquo;s coins is sufficient to make it unlikely that
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s can be copies of
V&iacute;rad√°man&rsquo;s it seems possible that the year of
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s overlordship may be the year
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;244 (K. 166) in which
Vijayasena&rsquo;s coins bear the title Kshatrapa, and that the
assumption of this lower title in the middle of a reign, which with
this exception throughout claims the title Mah√°kshatrapa, may be
due to the temporary necessity of acknowledging the supremacy of
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta. With reference to the Pandit&rsquo;s
suggestion that &Iacute;&#347;varadatta was an &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra the
fact noted above of a trace of Kshatrapa rule at Kar√°d
thirty-one miles south of S√°t√°ra together with the fact
that they held Apar√°nta or the Konkan makes it probable that
they reached Kar√°d by Chipl&uacute;n and the Kumbh√°rli
pass. That the Kshatrapas entered the Dakhan by so southerly a route
instead of by some one of the more central Th√°na passes, seems
to imply the presence of some hostile power in N√°sik and
Kh√°ndesh. This after the close of the second century
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> could hardly have been the &Aacute;ndhras
or <span class="corr" id="xd25e7468" title="Source: &#346;√°t√°karnis">&#346;√°takar&#7751;is</span>.
It may therefore be presumed to have been the &Aacute;ndhras&rsquo;
successors the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ras. As regards the third suggestion
that Kshatrapa Gujar√°t was overrun from the North Konkan it is
to be noted that the evidence of connection between
&Iacute;&#347;varasena of the N√°sik inscription (Cave X. No. 15)
and &Iacute;&#347;varadatta of the coins is limited to a probable
nearness in time and a somewhat slight similarity in name. On the other
hand no inscription or other record points to &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra
ascendancy in the North Konkan or South Gujar√°t. The presence of
an &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra power in the North Konkan seems inconsistent
with Kshatrapa rule at Kaly√°n and Kar√°d in the second
half of the third century. The position allotted to Aberia in the
Periplus (McCrindle, 113) inland from Surastrene, apparently in the
neighbourhood of Thar and P√°rkar; the finding of
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s coins in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a (N√°sik Gazetteer, XIII.
624); and (perhaps between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;230 and
240) the transfer westwards of the head-quarters of the Kshatrapa
kingdom seem all to point to the east rather than to the south, as the
side from which &Iacute;&#347;varadatta invaded Gujar√°t. At the
same time the reference during the reign of Rudrasim&#803;ha I.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;181) to the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra
Rudrabh&uacute;ti who like his father was Sen√°pati or
Commander-in-Chief suggests that &Iacute;&#347;varadatta may have been
not a foreigner but a revolted general. This supposition, his
assumption of the title Mah√°kshatrapa, and the finding of his
coins only in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a to a certain extent
confirm.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n53.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas, though meagre, serve to show that they were a
powerful dynasty who rose to consequence about the time of the middle
Kshatrapas (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250). All the recorded
information is in two copperplates, one the Kanheri copperplate found
by Dr. Bird in 1839,<a class="noteref" id="n55.1src" href="#n55.1"
name="n55.1src">1</a> the other a copperplate found at P√°rdi
near Bals√°r in 1885.<a class="noteref" id="n55.2src" href="#n55.2" name="n55.2src">2</a> Both plates are dated, the Kanheri plate
&lsquo;in the year two hundred and forty-five of the increasing rule of
the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas&rsquo;; the P√°rdi plate in
Sam&#803;vat 207 clearly figured. The Kanheri plate contains nothing of
historical importance; the P√°rdi plate gives the name of the
donor as Dahrasena or Dharasena &lsquo;the illustrious great king of
the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas.&rsquo; Though it does not give any royal
name the Kanheri plate expressly mentions the date as the year 245 of
the increasing rule of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas. The P√°rdi
plate gives the name of the king as &lsquo;of the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas&rsquo; but merely mentions the date as
Sam&#803;. 207. This date though not stated to be in the era of the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas must be taken to be dated in the same era as
the Kanheri plate seeing that the style of the letters of both plates
is very similar.</p>
<p>The initial date must therefore have been started by the founder of
the dynasty and the Kanheri plate proves the dynasty must have lasted
at least 245 years. The P√°rdi plate is one of the earliest
copper-plate grants in India. Neither the genealogy nor even the usual
three generations including the father and grandfather are given, nor
like later plates does it contain a wealth of attributes. The king is
called &lsquo;the great king of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas,&rsquo;
the performer of the <i>a&#347;vamedha</i> or horse-sacrifice, a
distinction bespeaking a powerful sovereign. It may therefore be
supposed that Dahrasena held South Gujar√°t to the <span class="corr" id="xd25e8186" title="Source: Narb√°da">Narbad√°</span> together with part of
the North Konkan and of the Gh√°t and Dakhan plateau.</p>

Harshavardhana.&rsquo; The name Jayasim&#803;havarmman does not occur
in any copperplate of the main line of the Western Chalukyas of the
Dakhan. That he is called Mah√°r√°ja or great king and that
his son &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya is called Yuvar√°ja or
heir-apparent suggest that Jayasim&#803;havarmman was the founder of
the Gujar√°t branch of the Western Chalukyas and that his great
Dakhan brother Vikram√°ditya was his overlord, a relation which
would explain the mention of Vikram√°ditya in the genealogy of
the copper-plate. Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s reign ended in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;680 (&#346;aka 602).<a class="noteref" id="n56.5src" href="#n56.5" name="n56.5src">11</a> Supposing
our grant to be dated in this last year of Vikram√°ditya,
Sam&#803;vat 421 should correspond to &#346;aka 602, which gives

date of the era in which the plate is dated. Probably the plate was
dated earlier in the reign of Vikram√°ditya giving <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250. In any case the era used cannot be the Gupta
era whose initial year is now finally settled to be <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319.</p>
<p>The second grant of the same &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya is dated
Sam&#803;vat 443. In it, both in an eulogistic verse at the beginning
and in the text of the genealogy, Vinay√°ditya
Saty√°&#347;raya Vallabha is mentioned as the paramount sovereign
which proves that by Sam&#803;vat 443 Vikram√°ditya had been
succeeded by Vinay√°ditya. The reign of Vinay√°ditya has
been fixed as lasting from &#346;aka 602 to &#346;aka 618 that is from

Bals√°r grant whose donor is mentioned as Mangalar√°ja son
of Jayasim&#803;havarmman, apparently the same as the

<p>These considerations seem to show that the initial date of the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era was at or about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250 which at once suggests its identity with the
Chedi or Kalachuri era.<a class="noteref" id="n57.1src" href="#n57.1"
name="n57.1src">14</a> The next question is, Who were these
Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas. The meaning of the title seems to be kings of
Trik&uacute;&#7789;a. Several references seem to point to the existence
of a city named Trik&uacute;&#7789;a on the western seaboard. In
describing Raghu&rsquo;s triumphant progress the
R√°m√°ya&#7751;a and the Raghuvam&#803;&#347;a mention him
as having established the city of Trik&uacute;&#7789;a in
Apar√°nta on the western seaboard.<a class="noteref" id="n57.2src" href="#n57.2" name="n57.2src">15</a> Trik&uacute;&#7789;akam
or Trik&uacute;&#7789;am, a Sanskrit name for sea salt seems a
reminiscence of the time when Trik&uacute;&#7789;a was the emporium
from which Konkan salt was distributed over the Dakhan. The scanty
information regarding the territory ruled by the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas is in agreement with the suggestion that
Junnar in North Poona was the probable site of their capital and that
in the three ranges that encircle Junnar we have the origin of the term
Trik&uacute;&#7789;a or Three-Peaked.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Their Race or Tribe.</span>Of the race or
tribe of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas nothing is known. The conjecture
may be offered that they are a branch of the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra kings
of the Pur√°&#7751;as, one of whom is mentioned in Inscription
XV. of N√°sik Cave X. which from the style of the letters belongs
to about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150 to 200. The easy
connection between N√°sik and Bals√°r by way of Peth
(Peint) and the nearness in time between the N√°sik inscription
and the initial date of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas support this
conjecture. The further suggestion may be offered that the founder of
the line of Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas was the &Iacute;&#347;varadatta,
who, as noted in the Kshatrapa chapter, held the overlordship of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a as Mah√°kshatrapa, perhaps
during the two years <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248 and 249, a
result in close agreement with the conclusions drawn from the
examination of the above quoted Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka and Chalukya
copperplates. As noted in the Kshatrapa chapter after two years&rsquo;
supremacy &Iacute;&#347;varadatta seems to have been defeated and
regular Kshatrapa rule restored about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;252 (K. 174) by
D√°m√°ja&#7693;a&#347;r&iacute; son of Vijayasena. The
unbroken use of the title Mah√°kshatrapa, the moderate and
uniform lengths of the reigns, and the apparently unquestioned
successions suggest, what the discovery of Kshatrapa coins at
Kar√°d near S√°t√°ra in the Dakhan and at
Amr√°vati in the Ber√°rs seems to imply, that during the
second half of the third century Kshatrapa rule was widespread and
firmly established.<a class="noteref" id="n57.3src" href="#n57.3" name="n57.3src">16</a> The conjecture may be offered that Rudrasena
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;256&ndash;272) whose coins have been
found in Amr√°vati in the Ber√°rs spread his power at the
expense of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas driving them towards the

themselves descendants of Kar&#7751;a the hero of the
Mah√°bh√°rata, and the Pallavas claimed to be of the
Bh√°radv√°ja stock, the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas forgot
their &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra origin and claimed descent from the
Haihayas. Again as the Valabhis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;480&ndash;767) adopted the Gupta era but gave it
their own name so the rulers of Tripura seem to have continued the
original Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248&ndash;9 under the name of the Chedi era. The
decline of the Kshatrapas dates from about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300 the rule of Vi&#347;vasena the twentieth
Kshatrapa son of Bhartt&#7771;id√°man. The subsequent disruption
of the Kshatrapa empire was probably the work of their old neighbours
and foes the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas, who, under the name of Haihayas,
about the middle of the fifth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;455&ndash;6) rose to supremacy and established a
branch at their old city of Trik&uacute;&#7789;a ruling the greater
part of the Bombay Dakhan and South Gujar√°t and probably filling
the blank between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;410 the fall of the

the obverse is a bust of bad workmanship and on the reverse are the

<p>At Kar√°d, thirty-one miles south of S√°t√°ra, Mr.
Justice Newton obtained a coin of this Rudraga&#7751;a, with the coins
of many Kshatrapas including Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha son of
Bhartt&#7771;id√°man who ruled up to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300. This would favour the view that
Rudraga&#7751;a was the successful rival who wrested the Dakhan and
North Konkan from Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha. The fact that during the
twenty years after Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300&ndash;320) none of the Kshatrapas has the
title Mah√°kshatrapa seems to show they ruled in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a as tributaries of this
Rudraga&#7751;a and his descendants of the Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka
family. The Dahrasena of the P√°rdi plate whose inscription date
is 207, that is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;457, may be a
descendant of Rudraga&#7751;a. The Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka kingdom
would thus seem to have flourished at least till the middle of the
fifth century. Somewhat later, or at any rate after the date of the
Kanheri plate (245 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;495), it was
overthrown by either the Mauryas or the Guptas.<a class="noteref" id="n58.1src" href="#n58.1" name="n58.1src">18</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>

&#346;an&#775;kara&#7751;a is the Chedi &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a
whose son Buddhar√°ja was defeated by Mangal&iacute;&#347;a some
time before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;602 (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIX. 16). If this is accepted, the
grant shows that the Chedis or Kalachuris were in power in the

century, which explains the prevalence of their era in South
Gujar√°t. Chedi rule in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e8485"
title="Source: Narb√°d√°">Narbad√°</span> valley must
have come to an end about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580 when
Dadda I. established himself at Broach. It being established that the
Kalachuris once ruled in South Gujar√°t, there is no great
difficulty in the way of identifying the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas with
them. The two known Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka grants are dated in the
third century of their era, and belong pal&aelig;ographically to the
fifth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> Their era, therefore, like
that of the Kalachuris, begins in the third century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>: and it is simpler to suppose that the two eras were
the same than <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter VI.<br>
<span class="sc">The Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250&ndash;450.</span></span> that two different
eras, whose initial points were only a few years apart, were in use in
the same district. Now that the &#346;aka and the Vikrama eras are
known to have had different names at different times, the change in the
name of the era offers no special difficulty. This identification would
carry back Kalachuri rule in South Gujar√°t to at least
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;456&ndash;6, the date of the
P√°rdi grant: and it is worth noting that Var√°hamihira
(B&#7771;. Sam&#803;h. XIV. 20) places the Haihayas or Kalachuris in
the west along with the Apar√°ntakas or Konkanis.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Though the name Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka means
of Trik&uacute;&#7789;a, the authorities quoted by Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l do not establish the existence of a city
called Trik&uacute;&#7789;a. They only vouch for a mountain of that
name somewhere in the Western Gh√°ts, and there is no evidence of
any special connection with Junnar. Further, the word
Trik&uacute;&#7789;akam seems to mean rock-salt, not sea-salt, so that
there is here no special connection with the Western coast. Wherever
Trik&uacute;&#7789;a may have been, there seems no need to reject the
tradition that connects the rise of the Kalachuris with their capture
of K√°lanjara (Cunningham&rsquo;s <abbr title="Arch&aelig;ological Survey">Arch. Surv.</abbr> IX. 77ff), as it is
more likely that they advanced from the East down the <span class="corr" id="xd25e8520" title="Source: Narb√°d√°">Narbad√°</span> than that their
original seats were on the West Coast, as the Western Indian
inscriptions of the third and fourth centuries contain no reference
either to Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas or to Junnar or other western city
as Trik&uacute;&#7789;a.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">With reference to the third suggestion that
the Traik&uacute;&#7789;akas twice overthrew the Kshatrapas, under
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248 and
under Rudraga&#7751;a in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;310&ndash;320, it is to be noted that there is no
evidence to show that &Iacute;&#347;varadatta was either an
&Aacute;bh&iacute;ra or a Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka and that the
identification of his date with <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248&ndash;250 seems less probable than with
either <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;244 or <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;236. (Compare above Footnote page 53). Even if
&Iacute;&#347;varadatta&rsquo;s supremacy coincided with <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250 the initial date of the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era, it seems improbable that a king who
reigned only two years and left no successor should have had any
connection with the establishment of an era which is not found in use
till two centuries later. As regards Rudraga&#7751;a it may be admitted
that he belonged to the race or family who weakened Kshatrapa power
early in the fourth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> At the same
time there seems no reason to suppose that Rudraga&#7751;a was a
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka or a Kalachuri except the fact that his name,
like that of &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a, is a compound of the word
<i>ga&#7751;a</i> and a name of &#346;iva; while the irregular
posthumous use of the title Mah√°kshatrapa among the latest (23rd

chief remains of Gupta records and coins are in the territory to the
east and south-east of Kanauj. Of the race of the Guptas nothing is

traders. Of the first three kings, Gupta Gha&#7789;otkacha and
Chandragupta I., beyond the fact that Chandragupta I. bore the title of
Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja, neither descriptive titles
nor details are recorded. As the fourth king Samudragupta performed the
long-neglected horse-sacrifice he must have been Br√°hmanical in
religion. And as inscriptions style Samudragupta&rsquo;s three
successors, Chandragupta II. Kum√°ragupta and Skandagupta, Parama
Bh√°gavata, they must have been Sm√°rta Vaishnavas, that is
devotees of <span class="corr" id="xd25e8740" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span> and observers of Vedic
ceremonies.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Founder Gupta, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319&ndash;322(?).</span>The founder of the
dynasty is styled Gupta. In inscriptions this name always appears as
&#346;r&iacute;-gupta which is taken to mean protected by
&#346;r&iacute; or Lakshm&iacute;. Against this explanation it is to be
noted that in their inscriptions all Gupta&rsquo;s successors, have a
&#346;r&iacute; before their names. The question therefore arises; If
&#346;r&iacute; forms part of the name why should the name
&#346;r&iacute;gupta have had no second &#346;r&iacute; prefixed in the
usual way. Further in the inscriptions the lineage appears as
Guptavam&#803;&#347;a that is the lineage of the Guptas never
&#346;r&iacute;guptavam&#803;&#347;a<a class="noteref" id="n61.1src"
href="#n61.1" name="n61.1src">3</a>; and whenever dates in the era of
this dynasty are given they are conjoined with the name Gupta never
with &#346;r&iacute;gupta.<a class="noteref" id="n61.2src" href="#n61.2" name="n61.2src">4</a> It may therefore be taken that Gupta not
&#346;r&iacute;gupta is the correct form of the founder&rsquo;s
name.<a class="noteref" id="n61.3src" href="#n61.3" name="n61.3src">5</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gha&#7789;otkacha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;322&ndash;349(?).</span>Gupta the founder seems
never to have risen to be more than a petty chief. No known inscription
gives him the title <i>Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja</i>
Supreme Ruler of Great Kings, which all Gupta rulers after the
founder&rsquo;s grandson Chandragupta assume. Again that no coins of
the founder and many coins of his successors have been discovered makes
it probable that Gupta was not a ruler of enough importance to have a
currency of his own. According to the inscriptions Gupta was succeeded
by his son Gha&#7789;otkacha a petty chief like his father with the
title of Mah√°r√°ja and without coins.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chandragupta I. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;349&ndash;369(?).</span>Chandragupta I.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;349&ndash;369 [?]), the son and
successor of Gha&#7789;otkacha, is styled
Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja either because he himself
became powerful, or, more probably, because he was the father of his
very powerful successor Samudragupta. Though he may not have gained the
dignity of &ldquo;supreme ruler of great kings&rdquo; by his own
successes Chandragupta I. rose to a higher position than his
predecessors. He was connected by marriage with the Lichchhavi dynasty
of Tirh&uacute;t an alliance which must have been considered of
importance since his son Samudragupta puts the name of his mother
<span class="corr" id="xd25e8794" title="Source: Kum√°r√°dev&iacute;">Kum√°radev&iacute;</span>

of his family to strike coins. His numerous gold coins are, with a
certain additional Indian element, adopted from those of his
Indo-Skythian predecessors. The details of the royal figure on the
obverse are Indian in the neck ornaments, large earrings, and
headdress; they are Indo-Skythian in the tailed coat, long boots, and
straddle. The goddess on the reverse of some coins with a fillet and
cornucopia is an adaptation of an Indo-Skythian figure, while the
lotus-holding Ganges on an alligator and the standing Glory holding a

Benares, Beh√°r, <span class="corr" id="xd25e9262" title="Source: Tirhut">Tirh&uacute;t</span>, Bengal, and part of East
R√°jput√°na. The list of Dakhan and South Indian kingdoms
does not necessarily imply that they formed part of
Samudragupta&rsquo;s territory. Samudragupta may have made a victorious
campaign to the far south and had the countries recorded in the order
of his line of march. The order suggests that he went from
Beh√°r, by way of Gay√°, to Kosala the country about the
modern R√°ipur in the Central Provinces, and from Kosala, by
Ganjam and other places in the Northern Circars, as far as
K√°&ntilde;ch&iacute; or Conjeveram forty-six miles south-west of
Madras. M√°lwa is shown in the second list as a powerful allied
kingdom. It does not appear to have formed part of Samudragupta&rsquo;s
territory nor, unless the &#346;akas are the Kshatrapas, does any
mention of Gujar√°t occur even as an allied state.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Chandragupta II. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;396&ndash;415.</span>Samudragupta was succeeded
by his son Chandragupta II. whose mother was the queen
Datt√°dev&iacute;. He was the greatest and most powerful king of
the Gupta dynasty and added largely to the territory left by
Samudragupta. His second name Vikram√°ditya or the Sun of Prowess
appears on his coins. Like his father Chandragupta II. struck gold
coins of various types. He was the first Gupta ruler who spread his
power over M√°lwa and Gujar√°t which he apparently took
from the Kshatrapas as he was the first Gupta to strike silver coins
and as his silver coins of both varieties the eastern and the western
are modifications of the Kshatrapa type. The expedition which conquered
M√°lwa seems to have passed from Allah√°b√°d by
Bundelkhand to Bhils√° and thence to M√°lwa. An undated
inscription in the Udayagiri caves at Vidi&#347;√° (the modern
Besnagar) near Bhilsa records the making of a cave of Mah√°deva
by one &#346;√°ba of the Kautsa gotra and the family name of

earlier.</p>
<p>A third inscription is on the railing of the great
S√°&ntilde;chi st&uacute;pa.<a class="noteref" id="n66.1src"
href="#n66.1" name="n66.1src">28</a> It is dated the 4th day of
Bh√°drapada Sam&#803;vat 93 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;412) and records the gift of 25
<i>d&iacute;n√°ras</i> and something called
&Iacute;&#347;varav√°saka (perhaps a village or a field) to the
monks of the great monastery of
K√°kan√°dabo&#7789;a&#347;r&iacute; for the daily
maintenance of five <i>bhikshus</i> and the burning of a lamp in the
<i>ratnag&#7771;iha</i> or shrine of the Buddhist <i>triratna</i>, for
the merit of the supreme king of great kings Chandragupta who bears the
popular name of Devar√°ja or god-like.<a class="noteref" id="n66.2src" href="#n66.2" name="n66.2src">29</a> The donor a feudatory
of Chandragupta named &Aacute;mrak√°rdava is described as having
the object of his life gratified by the favour of the feet of the
supreme ruler of great kings the illustrious Chandragupta, and as
showing to the world the hearty loyalty of a good feudatory.
&Aacute;mrak√°rdava seems to have been a chief of consequence as
he is described as winning the flag of glory in numerous battles. The
name of his kingdom is also recorded. Though it cannot now be made out
the mention of his kingdom makes it probable that he was a stranger
come to pay homage to Chandragupta. The reference to Chandragupta seems
to imply he was the ruler of the land while the two other inscriptions
show that his rule lasted from about 80 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;399) to at least 93 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;412). During these years Chandragupta seems to
have spread his sway to Ujjain the capital of west M√°lwa, of
which he is traditionally called the ruler. From Ujjain by way of
B√°gh and T√°nda in the province of R√°th he seems to
have entered South Gujar√°t and to have passed from the Broach
coast to K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. He seems to have
wrested K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a from its Kshatrapa rulers
as he is the first Gupta who struck silver coins and as his silver
coins are of the then current Kshatrapa type. On the obverse is the
royal bust with features copied from the Kshatrapa face and on the
reverse is the figure of a peacock, probably chosen as the bearer of
K√°rtikasv√°mi the god of war. Round the peacock is a
Sanskrit legend. This legend is of two varieties. In Central Indian
coins it runs:</p>

<p>Several gold coins of Chandragupta show a young male figure behind

Chandragupta&rsquo;s and the commonness of Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s

coins make it probable that on their conquest his father appointed
Kum√°ragupta viceroy of Gujar√°t and
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.</p>
<p>As the first Gupta was a chief of no great power or influence it is
probable that though it is calculated from him the Gupta era was
established not by him but by his grandson the great Chandragupta
II.<a class="noteref" id="n67.1src" href="#n67.1" name="n67.1src">32</a> This view is confirmed by the absence of dates on all
existing coins of Chandragupta&rsquo;s father Samudragupta. It further
seems probable that like the M√°lavas in <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;57 and the Kshatrapas in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 the occasion on which Chandragupta established
the Gupta era was his conquest of M√°lwa. The Gupta era did not
remain long in use. After the fall of Gupta power (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470) the old M√°lava era of <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;57 was revived. The conjecture may be offered
that, in spite of the passing away of Gupta power, under his title of
Vikram√°ditya, the fame of the great Gupta conqueror Chandragupta
II. lived on in M√°lwa and that, drawing to itself tales of
earlier local champions, the name Vikram√°ditya came to be
considered the name of the founder of the M√°lava era.<a class="noteref" id="n67.2src" href="#n67.2" name="n67.2src">33</a></p>
<p>Working back from Gupta Sam&#803;vat 80 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;400) the date of Chandragupta&rsquo;s conquest of
M√°lwa we may allot 1 to 12 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319&ndash;332) to the founder Gupta: 12 to 29
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;332&ndash;349) to Gupta&rsquo;s son

son Samudragupta who probably had a long reign. As the latest known
date of Chandragupta II. is 93 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;413)
and as a Bilsa&#7693; inscription<a class="noteref" id="n67.3src" href="#n67.3" name="n67.3src">34</a> of his successor Kum√°ragupta is
dated 96 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;416) the reign of

succeeded by his son Kum√°ragupta whose mother was the queen
Dhruva-Dev&iacute;. On Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s coins three titles
occur: Mahendra, Mahendra-Vikrama, and Mahendr√°ditya. As already
noticed the circulation of Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s coins in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a during his father&rsquo;s reign
makes it probable that on their conquest his father appointed him
viceroy of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Gujar√°t.
<span class="corr" id="xd25e9503" title="Source: Kumar√°gupta">Kum√°ragupta</span> appears to have
succeeded his father about 96 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;416).
An inscription at Mankuw√°r near Pray√°ga shows he was
ruling as late as 129 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;449) and a
coin of his dated 130 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450) adds at
least one year to his reign. On the other hand the inscription on the
Girn√°r rock shows that in 137 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;457) his son Skandagupta was king. It follows
that Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s reign ended between 130 and 137
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450&ndash;457) or about 133
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;453).</p>
<p>None of Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s four inscriptions gives any
historical or other details regarding him.<a class="noteref" id="n68.1src" href="#n68.1" name="n68.1src">35</a> But the number and the
wide distribution of his coins make it probable that during his long
reign he maintained his father&rsquo;s dominions intact.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s coins of gold silver and
copper have been found. The gold which are of various types are
inferior in workmanship to his father&rsquo;s coins. The silver and
copper coins are of two varieties, eastern and western. Both varieties
have on the obverse the royal bust in the Kshatrapa style of dress. In
the western pieces the bust is a copy of the moustached Kshatrapa face
with a corrupted version of the corrupt Greek legend used by the
Kshatrapas. The only difference between the obverses of the Western
Gupta and the Kshatrapa coins is that the date is in the Gupta instead
of in the Kshatrapa era. On the reverse is an ill formed peacock facing
front as in Chandragupta II.&rsquo;s coins. The legend runs:</p>

<p>In Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s eastern silver and copper coins the

corrupt Greek legend. The date is in front of the face in perpendicular
numerals one below the other instead of behind the head as in the
Kshatrapa and Western Kum√°ragupta coins. On the reverse is a
well-carved peacock facing front with tail feathers at full stretch.
Round the peacock runs the clear cut legend:</p>

<p><span class="marginnote">Skandagupta, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;454&ndash;470.</span>Kum√°ragupta was
succeeded by his son Skandagupta. An inscription of his on a pillar at

that on his father&rsquo;s death Skandagupta had a hard struggle to
establish his power.<a class="noteref" id="n69.2src" href="#n69.2"
name="n69.2src">38</a> The text runs: &ldquo;By whom when he rose to

on the earth as on a bed,&rdquo; an apparent reference to flight and
wanderings. A doubtful passage in the same inscription seems to show
that he was opposed by a powerful king named Pushyamitra on whose back
he is said to have set his left foot.<a class="noteref" id="n69.4src"
href="#n69.4" name="n69.4src">40</a> The inscription makes a further
reference to the troubles of the family stating that on re-establishing
the shaken fortune of his house Skandagupta felt satisfied and went to
see his weeping afflicted mother. Among the enemies with whom
Skandagupta had to contend the inscription mentions a close conflict
with the H&uacute;&#7751;as that is the Ephthalites, Thetals, or White
Huns.<a class="noteref" id="n69.5src" href="#n69.5" name="n69.5src">41</a> Verse 3 of Skandagupta&rsquo;s Girn√°r
inscription confirms the reference to struggles stating that on the
death of his father by his own might he humbled his enemies to the
earth and established himself. As the Girn√°r inscription is
dated 136 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;456) and as
Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s reign ended about 134, these troubles and
difficulties did not last for more than two years. The Girn√°r
inscription further states that on establishing his power he conquered
the earth, destroyed the arrogance of his enemies, and appointed
governors in all provinces. For Sur√°sh&#7789;ra he selected a
governor named Par&#7751;adatta and to Par&#7751;adatta&rsquo;s son
Chakrap√°lita he gave a share of the management placing him in
charge of Jun√°ga&#7693;h city. During the governorship of
Par&#7751;adatta the <span class="corr" id="xd25e9648" title="Source: Sudars√°na">Sudar&#347;ana</span> lake close to

site of the lake is in the west valley of the Girn√°r hill near
what is called Bhavan√°tha&rsquo;s pass.<a class="noteref" id="n70.1src" href="#n70.1" name="n70.1src">43</a> The inscription also
records the making of a temple of Vish&#7751;u in the neighbourhood by
Chakrap√°lita, which was probably on the site of the modern
D√°modar&rsquo;s Mandir in the Bhavan√°tha pass, whose
image is of granite and is probably as old as the Guptas. A new temple
was built in the fifteenth century during the rule of Mandalika the

ruler of Jun√°ga&#7693;h. At the time of the Musalm√°n
conquest (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1484) as violence was
feared the images were removed and buried. Mandalika&rsquo;s temple was
repaired by Amarji Div√°n of Jun√°ga&#7693;h
(1759&ndash;1784). It was proposed to make and consecrate new images.
But certain old images of Vish&#7751;u were found in digging
foundations for the enclosure wall and were consecrated. Two of these
images were taken by Girn√°ra Br√°hmans and consecrated in
the names of Baladevji and Revat&iacute; in a neighbouring temple
specially built for them. Of the original temple the only trace is a
pilaster built into the wall to the right as one enters. The style and
carving are of the Gupta period.</p>
<p>As almost all the Gupta coins found in Cutch are Skandagupta&rsquo;s
and very few are Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s, Skandagupta seems to have
added Cutch to the provinces of Gujar√°t and
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a inherited from his father. In
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Skandagupta&rsquo;s coins are
rare, apparently because of the abundant currency left by his father
which was so popular in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a that
fresh Kum√°ragupta coins of a degraded type were issued as late
as Valabhi times.</p>
<p>Like his father, Skandagupta issued a gold coinage in his eastern
dominions but no trace of a gold currency appears in the west. Like
Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s his silver coins were of two varieties,
eastern and western. The eastern coins have on the obverse a bust as in
Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s coins and the date near the face. On the
reverse is a peacock similar to Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s and round
the peacock the legend:</p>

belonged to the Gupta dynasty appears from his name as well as from his
silver coins which are dated in the Gupta era and are the same in style
as the eastern coins of Skandagupta. On the obverse is the usual bust

<p>Since the coins are dated Sam&#803;vat 174 and 180 odd (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;494 and 500 odd) and the inscription&rsquo;s date
is 165 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;485) the inscription may be
taken to belong to the early part of Budhagupta&rsquo;s reign the
beginning of which may be allotted to about 160&ndash;162 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;480&ndash;482). As this is more than ten years
later than the latest known date of Skandagupta (G. 149 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;469) either a Gupta of whom no trace remains must
have intervened or the twelve blank years must have been a time of
political change and disturbance. The absence of any trace of a gold
currency suggests that Budhagupta had less power than his predecessors.
The correctness of this argument is placed beyond doubt by the pillar
inscription opposite the shrine in the Era&#7751; temple where instead
of his predecessor&rsquo;s title of monarch of the whole earth
Budhagupta is styled protector of the land between the Jamna
(K√°lind&iacute;) and the <span class="corr" id="xd25e9835"
title="Source: Narb√°d√°">Narbad√°</span> implying
the loss of the whole territory to the east of the Jamna.<a class="noteref" id="n71.5src" href="#n71.5" name="n71.5src">50</a> In the
west the failure of Gupta power seems still more complete. Neither in
Gujar√°t nor in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a has an
inscription or even a coin been found with a reference to Budhagupta or
to any other Gupta ruler later than Skandagupta (G. 149 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;469). The pillar inscription noted above which is
of the year 165 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;485) and under the
rule of Budhagupta states that the pillar was a gift to the temple by
Dhanya Vish&#7751;u and his brother M√°t&#7771;i Vish&#7751;u who
at the time of the gift seem to have been local Br√°hman
governors. A second inscription on the lower part of the neck of a huge
Boar or Var√°ha image in a corner shrine of the same temple
records that the image was completed on the tenth day of
Ph√°lguna in the first year of the reign of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>

heaven.<a class="noteref" id="n72.1src" href="#n72.1" name="n72.1src">51</a> Since M√°t&#7771;i was alive in the Budhagupta
and was dead in the Toram√°&#7751;a inscription it follows that
Toram√°&#7751;a was later than Budhagupta. His name and his new
era show that Toram√°&#7751;a was not a Gupta. A further proof
that Toram√°&#7751;a wrested the kingdom from Budhagupta is that
except the change of era and that the bust turns to the left instead of
to the right, Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s silver coins are directly
adapted from Gupta coins of the eastern type. Certain coin dates seem
at variance with the view that Toram√°&#7751;a flourished after
Budhagupta. On several coins the date 52 is clear. As
Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s coins are copies of the coins of
Kum√°ragupta and Skandagupta and as most of these coins have a
numeral for one hundred the suggestion may be offered that a one
dropped out in striking Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s die and that this
date should read 152 not 52. Accepting this view
Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s date would be 152 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;472) that is immediately after the death of
Skandagupta.</p>
<p>The Gw√°lior inscription<a class="noteref" id="n72.2src" href="#n72.2" name="n72.2src">52</a> mentions prince Mihirakula as the son
of Toram√°&#7751;a and a second inscription from a well in
Mandasor<a class="noteref" id="n72.3src" href="#n72.3" name="n72.3src">53</a> dated M√°lava Sam&#803;vat 589 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;533) mentions a king named Ya&#347;odharman who
was ruler of M√°lwa when the well was built and who in a second
Mandasor inscription<a class="noteref" id="n72.4src" href="#n72.4"
name="n72.4src">54</a> is mentioned as having conquered Mihirakula.
This would separate Mihirakula from his father Toram√°&#7751;a
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;471) by more than sixty years. In
explanation of this gap it may be suggested that the [1]52
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;472) coins were struck early in
Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s reign in honour of his conquest of the
eastern Gupta territory. A reign of twenty years would bring
Toram√°&#7751;a to 177 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;497).
The Gw√°lior inscription of Mihirakula is in the fifteenth year
of his reign that is on the basis of a succession date of 177
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;497) in Gupta 192 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;512). An interval of five years would bring
Ya&#347;odharman&rsquo;s conquest of Mihirakula to 197 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;517). This would place the making of the well in
the twenty-first year of Mihirakula&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Bh√°nugupta, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;511.</span>After Budhagupta neither inscription

name="n72.5src">55</a> found in 1869 on a <i>lin&#775;ga</i>-shaped

Gopar√°j√° who is mentioned as the daughter&rsquo;s son of
Sarabhar√°ja and appears to have been the son of king
M√°dhava. Much of the inscription is lost. What remains records
the passing to heaven of the deceased king in the very destructive
fight with the great warrior (<i>prav&iacute;ra</i>) Bh√°nugupta
brave as P√°rtha. The inscription is dated the seventh of dark
Bh√°drapada Gupta 191 in words as well as in numerals that is in

the successor of Budhagupta ruling over a petty M√°lwa
principality which lasted till nearly the time of the great
Harshavardhana the beginning of the seventh century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;607&ndash;650), as a Devagupta of M√°lwa is

<p><span class="marginnote">The Pushyamitras, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;455.</span>[Though the history of their last
years is known only in fragments, chiefly from inscriptions and coins,
little doubt remains regarding the power which first seriously weakened
the early Guptas. The Bhitari stone pillar of Skandagupta<a class="noteref" id="n73.2src" href="#n73.2" name="n73.2src">57</a> speaks of
his restoring the fortunes of his family and conquering the
Pushyamitras and also of his joining in close conflict with the
H&uacute;&#7751;as.<a class="noteref" id="n73.3src" href="#n73.3" name="n73.3src">58</a> Unfortunately the Bhitari inscription is not dated.
The Jun√°ga&#7693;h inscription, which bears three dates covering
the period between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;455 and
458,<a class="noteref" id="n73.4src" href="#n73.4" name="n73.4src">59</a> mentions pride-broken enemies in the country of the
Mlechchhas admitting Skandagupta&rsquo;s victory. That the Mlechchhas
of this passage refers to the Huns is made probable by the fact that it
does not appear that the Pushyamitras were Mlechchhas while they and
the Huns are the only enemies whom Skandagupta boasts either of
defeating or of meeting in close conflict. It may therefore be assumed
that the Huns became known to Skandagupta before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;455. As according to the Chinese
historians<a class="noteref" id="n73.5src" href="#n73.5" name="n73.5src">60</a> the White Huns did not cross the Oxus into Baktria
before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;452, the founding of the Hun
capital of Badeghis<a class="noteref" id="n73.6src" href="#n73.6" name="n73.6src">61</a> may be fixed between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;452 and 455. As the above quoted inscriptions
indicate that the Huns were repulsed in their first attempt to take
part in Indian politics the disturbances during the last years of
Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s reign were probably due to some tribe other
than the Huns. This tribe seems to have been the Pushyamitras whose
head-quarters would seem to have been in Northern India. Some other
enemy must have arisen in M√°lwa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

the terms of Par&#7751;adatta&rsquo;s appointment to
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;455&ndash;6

by Skandagupta which would naturally be the case if a rival state had
arisen in M√°lwa and been overthrown by that king. So far as is
known the Huns made no successful attack on the Gupta empire during the
lifetime of Skandagupta whose latest date is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;468&ndash;9. It is not certain who succeeded
Skandagupta. His brother Pura(or Sthira-)gupta ruled in or near
Magadha. But it is not certain whether he was the successor or the
rival of Skandagupta.<a class="noteref" id="n74.1src" href="#n74.1"

his life the empire was not divided nor does any one of his

<p><span class="marginnote">White Huns, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450&ndash;520.</span>Among the northerners who
with or shortly after the Pushyamitras shared in the overthrow of Gupta
power two names, a father and a son, Toram√°&#7751;a and
Mihirakula are prominent. It is not certain that these kings were
H&uacute;&#7751;as by race. Their tribe were almost certainly his
rivals&rsquo; allies whom Skandagupta&rsquo;s Bhitari and
Jun√°ga&#7693;h inscriptions style the one H&uacute;&#7751;as the

This though not impossible is somewhat unlikely. The date of

throne he was a young man probably not more than 25. If his father
reigned fifty-two years he must have been at least 70 when he died and
not less than 45 when Mihirakula was born. As Mihirakula is known to
have had at least one younger brother,<a class="noteref" id="n74.10src"
href="#n74.10" name="n74.10src">71</a> it seems probable that

suggestion may be offered that that event was the establishment of the

Badeghis,<a class="noteref" id="n74.12src" href="#n74.12" name="n74.12src">73</a> which, as fixed above between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;452 and 455, gives the very suitable date of

other records of Mihirakula&rsquo;s character. It seems therefore
reasonable to suppose that the warlike sovereign who treated Sungyun

other than the meteor Mihirakula. If Sungyun is correct in stating that
Mihirakula was the third of his line the dynasty must have been
established about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;460. Beal is in
doubt whether the name Lae-lih given by Sungyun<a class="noteref" id="n75.3src" href="#n75.3" name="n75.3src">77</a> is the family name or
the name of the founder. As a recently deciphered inscription shows

correct transliteration of the Chinese characters, is the name of the

Ya&#347;odharman of M√°lwa, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;533&ndash;4.</span> Possibly Bandhuvarman
afterwards threw off his allegiance to the Guptas and thereby caused
the temporary loss of <span class="corr" id="xd25e10414" title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> towards the
end of Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s reign. Nothing further is recorded of
the rulers of M√°lwa until the reign of Ya&#347;odharman in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;533&ndash;4.<a class="noteref" id="n77.1src" href="#n77.1" name="n77.1src">93</a> It has been supposed
that one of Ya&#347;odharman&rsquo;s inscriptions mentioned a king
<span class="corr" id="xd25e10426" title="Source: Vishnuvardhana">Vish&#7751;uvardhana</span> but there can be
little doubt that both names refer to the same person.<a class="noteref" id="n77.2src" href="#n77.2" name="n77.2src">94</a> The name
of Ya&#347;odharman&rsquo;s tribe is unknown and his crest the
<i>aulikara</i> has not been satisfactorily explained.<a class="noteref" id="n77.3src" href="#n77.3" name="n77.3src">95</a>
Mandasor<a class="noteref" id="n77.4src" href="#n77.4" name="n77.4src">96</a> in Western M√°lwa, where all his inscriptions
have been found, must have been a centre of Ya&#347;odharman&rsquo;s
power. Ya&#347;odharman boasts<a class="noteref" id="n77.5src" href="#n77.5" name="n77.5src">97</a> of conquering from the Brahmaputra to
mount Mahendra and from the Him√°layas to the Western Ocean. In
the sixth century only one dynasty could claim such widespread power.
That dynasty is the famous family of Ujjain to which belonged the well
known Vikram√°ditya of the Nine Gems. It may be conjectured not
only that Ya&#347;odharman belonged to this family but that
Ya&#347;odharman was the great Vikram√°ditya himself.<a class="noteref" id="n77.6src" href="#n77.6" name="n77.6src">98</a></p>
<p>The difficult question remains by whom was the power of Mihirakula
overthrown. Ya&#347;odharman claims to have subdued Mihirakula, who, he
distinctly says, had never before been defeated.<a class="noteref" id="n77.7src" href="#n77.7" name="n77.7src">99</a> On the other hand,
Hiuen Tsiang ascribes Mihirakula&rsquo;s overthrow to a
B√°l√°ditya of Magadha.<a class="noteref" id="n77.8src"
href="#n77.8" name="n77.8src">100</a> Coins prove that
B√°l√°ditya<a class="noteref" id="n77.9src" href="#n77.9"
name="n77.9src">101</a> was one of the titles of Narasim&#803;hagupta
grandson of Kum√°ragupta I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;417&ndash;453) who probably ruled Magadha as his
son&rsquo;s seal was found in the Gh√°zipur district.<a class="noteref" id="n77.10src" href="#n77.10" name="n77.10src">102</a> If
Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s story is accepted a slight chronological
difficulty arises in the way of this identification. It is clear that
Mihirakula&rsquo;s first defeat was at the hands of Ya&#347;odharman
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;530. His defeat and capture by
B√°l√°ditya must have been later. As Skandagupta&rsquo;s
reign ended about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470 a blank of
sixty years has to be filled by the two reigns of his brother and his
nephew.<a class="noteref" id="n77.11src" href="#n77.11" name="n77.11src">103</a> This, though not impossible, suggests caution in
identifying B√°l√°ditya. According to Hiuen Tsiang
B√°l√°ditya was a feudatory of Mihirakula who rebelled
against him when he began to persecute the Buddhists. Hiuen Tsiang
notices that, at the intercession of his own mother,
B√°l√°ditya spared Mihirakula&rsquo;s life and allowed him
to retire to Kashmir. He further notices that Mihirakula and his
brother were rivals and his statement suggests that from Kashmir
Mihirakula defeated his brother and recovered Gandh√°ra. The
ascendancy of the White Huns cannot have lasted long after Mihirakula.
About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;560 the power of the White Huns
was crushed between the combined attacks of the Persians and
Turks.<a class="noteref" id="n77.12src" href="#n77.12" name="n77.12src">104</a>&mdash;(A.M.T.J.)] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>

Fleet believes that the Lichchhavi family concerned was that of
Nep√°l, and that they were the real founders of the era used by
the Guptas. Dr. B&uuml;hler (Vienna Or. Journal, V. Pt. 3) holds that
Chandragupta married into the Lichchhavi family of
P√°&#7789;aliputra, and became king of that country in right of
his wife. The coins which bear the name of <span class="corr" id="xd25e8803" title="Source: Kum√°radevi">Kum√°radev&iacute;</span> are by Mr.
Smith (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A.
S.</abbr> (<abbr title="New Series">N. S.</abbr>) XXI. 63) and others
assigned to Chandragupta I., reading the reverse legend
<i>Lichchhavayah&#803;</i> The Lichchhavis in place of Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s <i>Lichchhaveyah&#803;</i>
Daughter&rsquo;s son of Lichchhavi. On the K√°cha coins see below
page 62 note 2.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The Lichchhavis claim to be sprung from the
solar dynasty. Manu (Burnell&rsquo;s Manu, 308) describes them as
descended from a degraded Kshatriya. Beal (<abbr title="Royal Asiatic Society">R. A. S.</abbr> <abbr title="New Series">N.
S.</abbr> XIV. 39) would identify them with an early wave of the Yuechi
or Kush√°ns; Smith (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 55 n. 2)
and Hewitt (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A.
S.</abbr> XX. 355&ndash;366) take them to be a Kolarian or local tribe.
The fame of the Lichchhavis of Va&iacute;s√°li or Passal&aelig;
between Patna and Tirh&uacute;t goes back to the time of Gautama Buddha
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;480) in whose funeral rites the
Lichchhavis and their neighbours and associates the Mallas took a
prominent share (Rockhill&rsquo;s Life of Buddha, 62&ndash;63, 145,
203. Compare Legge&rsquo;s Fa Hien, 71&ndash;76; Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist
Records, II. 67, 70, 73, 77 and 81 note). According to Buddhist
writings the first king of Thibet (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;50) who was elected by the chiefs of the South
Thibet tribes was a Lichchhavi the son of Prasenadjit of Ko&#347;ala
(Rockhill&rsquo;s Life of Buddha, 208). Between the seventh and ninth
centuries (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;635&ndash;854) a family of
Lichchhavis was ruling in Nepal (Fleet&rsquo;s <abbr title="Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum">Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. 134). The
earliest historical member of the Nep√°l family is Jayadeva I.
whose date is supposed to be about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;330 to 355. Mr. Fleet (Ditto, 135) suggests that
Jayadeva&rsquo;s reign began earlier and may be the epoch from which
the Gupta era of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;318&ndash;319 is
taken. He holds (Ditto, 136) that in all probability the so-called
Gupta era is a Lichchhavi era.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n61.4src">&uarr;</a></p>

standing on an alligator with a stalked lotus in her left hand on the

letters <span lang="sa">&#2325; &#2330;</span> that is <i>ka cha</i> on
the obverse under the arm of the royal figure, has led the late Mr.
Thomas, General Cunningham, and Mr. Smith to suppose that the coins
belonged to Gha&#7789;otkacha, the last two letters of the name being
the same. This identification seems improbable. Gha&#7789;otkacha was
never powerful enough to have a currency of his own.
<i>Sarvar√°jochchhett√°</i> the attribute on the reverse is
one of Samudragupta&rsquo;s epithets, while the figure of the king on
the obverse grasping the standard with the disc, illustrating the
attribute of universal sovereignty, can refer to none other than
Samudragupta the first very powerful king of the dynasty. Perhaps the
Kacha or K√°cha on these coins is a pet or child name of
Samudragupta. Mr. Rapson (Numismatic Chron. 3rd Ser. XI. 48ff) has
recently suggested that the K√°cha coins belong to an elder
brother and predecessor of Samudragupta. But it seems unlikely that a
ruler who could justly claim the title Destroyer-of-all-kings should be
passed over in silence in the genealogy. Further, as is remarked above,
the title <i>Sarvar√°jochchhett√°</i> belongs in the
inscriptions to Samudragupta alone: and the fact that in his lifetime
Samudragupta&rsquo;s father chose him as successor is against his
exclusion from the throne even for a time.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

Devaputra, Sh√°hi, and Sh√°h√°nush√°hi, belong
to the Kush√°n dynasty of Kanishka (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78). Sh√°h√°nush√°hi is the
oldest, as it appears on the coins from Kanishka downwards in the form
Sh√°han√°no Sh√°ho (Stein in Babylonian and Oriental
Record, I. 163). It represents the old Persian title
Sh√°hansh√°h or king of kings. Sh√°hi, answering to
the simple Sh√°h, appears to be first used alone by
V√°sudeva (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;128&ndash;176). The
title of Devaputra occurs first in the inscriptions of Kanishka. In the
present inscription all three titles seem to denote divisions of the
Kush√°n empire in India. The title of Sh√°hi was continued
by the Turks (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600?&ndash;900) and
Br√°hmans (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;900&ndash;1000) of
K√°bul (Alberuni, II. 10) and by the Sh√°his (Elliot, I.
138) of Alor in Sindh (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;490?&ndash;631). Unless it refers to the last
remnants of the Gujar√°t Mah√°kshatrapas the word &#346;aka
seems to be used in a vague sense in reference to the non-Indian tribes
of the North-West frontier. The Muru&#7751;&#7693;as may be identified

with the people of Lamp√°ka or Lamgh√°n twenty miles

130ff) argues that the era was borrowed from Nepal after Chandragupta
I. married his Lichchhavi queen. Dr. B&uuml;hler thinks there is no
evidence of this, and that the era was started by the Guptas themselves
(Vienna Or. Jl. V. Pt. 3).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n67.1src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n67.2"
href="#n67.2src" name="n67.2">33</a></span> The further suggestion may
be offered that if as seems probable Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l is
correct in considering Chandragupta II. to be the founder of the Gupta
era this high honour was due not to his conquest of M√°lwa but to
some success against the Indo-Skythians or &#346;akas of the
Punj√°b. The little more than nominal suzerainty claimed over the
Devputras, Sh√°his, and Sh√°h√°nush√°his in
Chandragupta&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s inscription shows that when he came
to the throne Chandragupta found the &#346;aka power practically
unbroken. The absence of reference to conquests is no more complete in
the case of the Panj√°b than it is in the case of Gujar√°t
or of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a which Chandragupta is known
to have added to his dominions. In
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, though not in Gujar√°t,
the evidence from coins is stronger than in the Panj√°b. Still
the discovery of Chandragupta&rsquo;s coins (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 5 note
1) raises the presumption of conquests as far north and west as
<span class="corr" id="xd25e9439" title="Source: Panipat">P√°nipat</span> and as Ludhi√°na (in the
heart of the Panj√°b). Chandragupta&rsquo;s name Devar√°ja
may, as Pandit Bhagv√°nl√°l suggests, be taken from the
&#346;aka title Devaputra. Further, the use of the name
Vikram√°ditya and of the honorific &#346;r&iacute; is in striking
agreement with Beruni&rsquo;s statement (Sachau, II. 6) that the
conqueror of the &#346;akas was named Vikram√°ditya and that to
the conqueror&rsquo;s name was added the title &#346;r&iacute;. Mr.
Fleet (<abbr title="Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum">Corp. Ins.
Ind.</abbr> III. 37 note 2) holds it not improbable that either
Chandragupta I. or II. defeated the Indo-Skythians. The fact that
Chandragupta I. was not a ruler of sufficient importance to issue coins
and that even after his son Samudragupta&rsquo;s victories the
&#346;akas remained practically independent make it almost certain that
if any subjection of the &#346;akas to the Guptas took place it
happened during the reign of Chandragupta II.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<p class="footnote cont">The sense of the inscription is somewhat
doubtful. Mr. Fleet (<abbr title="Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum">Corp.
Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. page 62) translates: Whose fame, moreover, even
(his) enemies in the countries of the Mlechchhas &hellip; having their
pride broken down to the very root announce with the words
&lsquo;Verily the victory has been achieved by him.&rsquo; Prof.
Peterson understands the meaning to be that Skandagupta&rsquo;s Indian
enemies were forced to retire beyond the borders of India among
friendly Mlechchhas and in a foreign land admit that the renewal of
their conflict with Skandagupta was beyond hope. The retreat of
Skandagupta&rsquo;s Indian enemies to the Mlechchhas suggests the
Mlechchhas are the H&uacute;&#7751;as that is the White Huns who were
already in power on the Indian border, whom the enemies had previously
in vain brought as allies into India to help them against Skandagupta.
This gives exactness to the expression used in Skandagupta&rsquo;s
Bhitari inscription (<abbr title="Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum">Corp.
Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Number 13 page 56) that he joined in close
conflict with the H&uacute;&#7751;as &hellip; among enemies, as if in
this conflict the H&uacute;&#7751;as were the allies of enemies rather
than the enemies themselves. For the introduction into India of foreign
allies, compare in <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;327

is pure Persian. The true form may then be Mihiragula, that is Sun
Rose, a name which the personal beauty of the prince may have gained
him. &lsquo;I have heard of my son&rsquo;s wisdom and beauty and wish
once to see his face&rsquo; said the fate-reading mother of king

Mihirakula, was the type of conqueror round whom legends gather, Cosmas

Val&#803;eh Town, 1893.</span> <span class="marginnote">Val&#803;eh
Town, 1893.</span>The Valabhi dynasty, which succeeded the Guptas in
Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, take their
name from their capital in the east of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a about twenty miles west of
Bh√°vnagar and about twenty-five miles north of the holy Jain
hill of <span class="corr" id="xd25e10541" title="Source: Satru&ntilde;jaya">&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya</span>. The modern
name of Valabhi is Val&#803;eh. It is impossible to say whether the
modern Val&#803;eh is a corruption of Valahi the Prakrit form of the
Sanskrit Valabhi or whether Valabhi is Sanskritised from a local
original Val&#803;eh. The form Valahi occurs in the writings of
Jinaprabhasuri a learned Jain of the thirteenth century who describes
&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya as in the Val√°haka province. A town in
the chiefship of Val&#803;eh now occupies the site of old
Valabhi,<a class="noteref" id="n78.1src" href="#n78.1" name="n78.1src">1</a> whose ruins lie buried below thick layers of black
earth and silt under the modern town and its neighbourhood. The only
remains of old buildings are the large foundation bricks of which,
except a few new houses, the whole of Val&#803;eh is built. The absence
of stone supports the theory that the buildings of old Valabhi were of
brick and wood. In 1872 when the site was examined the only stone
remains were a few scattered Lin&#775;gas and a well-polished life-size
granite Nandi or bull lying near a modern Mah√°deva temple.
Diggers for old bricks have found copper pots and copperplates and
small Buddhist relic shrines with earthen pots and clay seals of the
seventh century.</p>
<p>The ruins of Valabhi show few signs of representing a large or
important city. The want of sweet water apparently unfits the site for
the capital of so large a kingdom as Valabhi. Its choice as capital was
probably due to its being a harbour on the Bh√°vnagar creek.

Val&#803;eh Town, 1893.</span> the days of Valabhi&rsquo;s prime the
silt which thickly covers the ruins has also filled and choked the
channel which once united it with the Bh√°vnagar creek when the
small Ghelo was probably a fair sized river.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Valabhi in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630</span>In spite of the disappearance of every
sign of greatness Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640) details show how rich and populous Valabhi
was in the early part of the seventh century. The country was about
1000 miles (6000 <i>li</i>) and the capital about five miles (30
<i>li</i>) in circumference. The soil the climate and the manners of
the people were like those of M√°lava. The population was dense;
the religious establishments rich. Over a hundred merchants owned a
hundred <i>l√°khs</i>. The rare and valuable products of distant
regions were stored in great quantities. In the country were several
hundred monasteries or <i>sangh√°r√°mas</i> with about 6000
monks. Most of them studied the Little Vehicle according to the
Sammatiya school. There were several hundred temples of Devas and
sectaries of many sorts. When Tath√°gata or Gautama Buddha
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;560&ndash;480) lived he often
travelled through this country. King A&#347;oka (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;240) had raised monuments or <i>st&uacute;pas</i>
in all places where Buddha had rested. Among these were spots where the
three past Buddhas sat or walked or preached. At the time of Hiuen
Tsiang&rsquo;s account (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640) the king
was of the Kshatriya caste, as all Indian rulers were. He was the
nephew of &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya of M√°lava and the
son-in-law of the son of &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya the reigning king
of Kany√°kubja. His name was Dhruvapa&#7789;u
(Tu-lu-h&rsquo;o-po-tu). He was of a lively and hasty disposition,
shallow in wisdom and statecraft. He had only recently attached himself
sincerely to the faith in the three precious ones. He yearly summoned a
great assembly and during seven days gave away valuable gems and choice
meats. On the monks he bestowed in charity the three garments and
medicaments, or their equivalents in value, and precious articles made
of the seven rare and costly gems. These he gave in charity and
redeemed at twice their price. He esteemed the virtuous, honoured the
good, and revered the wise. Learned priests from distant regions were
specially honoured. Not far from the city was a great monastery built
by the Arhat &Aacute;ch√°ra (&rsquo;O-che-lo), where, during
their travels, the Bodhisattvas Gunamati and Sthiramati (Kien-hwni)
settled and composed renowned treatises.<a class="noteref" id="n79.1src" href="#n79.1" name="n79.1src">3</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Valabhi Copperplates.</span>The only
historical materials regarding the Valabhi dynasty are their
copperplates of which a large number have been found. That such
powerful rulers as the Valabhis should leave no records on stones and
no remains of religious or other buildings is probably because, with
one possible exception at Gopn√°th,<a class="noteref" id="n79.2src" href="#n79.2" name="n79.2src">4</a> up to the ninth century
all temples and religious buildings in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Gujar√°t were of brick
and wood.<a class="noteref" id="n79.3src" href="#n79.3" name="n79.3src">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>

Chapter VIII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Valabhis, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766.</span><br>
Valabhi Copperplates.</span> The Valabhi copperplates chiefly record
grants to <span class="corr" id="xd25e10703" title="Source: Brahmanical">Br√°hmanical</span> temples and Buddhist
monasteries and sometimes to individuals. All are in one style two
plates inscribed breadthwise on the inner side, the earliest plates
being the smallest. The plates are held together by two rings passed
through two holes in their horizontal upper margin. One of the rings
bears on one side a seal with, as a badge of the religion of the
dynasty, a well-proportioned seated Nandi or bull. Under the bull is
the word Bha&#7789;√°rka the name of the founder of the dynasty.
Except such differences as may be traced to the lapse of time, the
characters are the same in all, and at the same time differ from the
character then in use in the Valabhi territory which must have been
that from which Devan√°gar&iacute; is derived. The Valabhi plate
character is adopted from that previously in use in South
Gujar√°t plates which was taken from the South Indian character.
The use of this character suggests that either Bha&#7789;√°rka or
the clerks and writers of the plates came from South
Gujar√°t.<a class="noteref" id="n80.1src" href="#n80.1" name="n80.1src">6</a> The language of all the grants is Sanskrit prose. Each
records the year of the grant, the name of the king making the grant,
the name of the grantee, the name of the village or field granted, the
name of the writer of the charter either the minister of peace and war
<i lang="sa-latn">sandhivigrah√°dhik&#7771;ita</i> or the
military head <i lang="sa-latn">bal√°dhik&#7771;ita</i>, and
sometimes the name of the <i lang="sa-latn">d&uacute;taka</i> or
gift-causer generally some officer of influence or a prince and in one
case a princess. The grants begin by recording they were made either
&lsquo;from Valabhi&rsquo; the capital, or &lsquo;from the royal
camp&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang="sa-latn">Vijayaskandh√°v√°ra</i>.&rsquo; Then follows the
genealogy of the dynasty from Bha&#7789;√°rka the founder to the
grantor king. Each king has in every grant a series of attributes which
appear to have been fixed for him once for all. Except in rare
instances the grants contain nothing historical. They are filled with
verbose description and figures of speech in high flown Sanskrit. As
enjoined in law-books or <i lang="sa-latn">dharma&#347;√°stras</i> after the genealogy of the
grantor comes the name of the composer usually the minister of peace
and war and after him the boundaries of the land granted. The plates
conclude with the date of the grant, expressed in numerals following
the letter <i lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;</i> or the letters <i lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;va</i> for <i lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;vatsara</i>
that is year. After the numerals are given the lunar month and day and
the day of the week, with, at the extreme end, the sign manual <i lang="sa-latn">svahasto mama</i> followed by the name of the king in the
genitive case that is Own hand of me so and so. The name of the era in
which the date is reckoned is nowhere given.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Period Covered.</span>So far as is known
the dates extend for 240 years from 207 to 447. That the earliest known
date is so late as 207 makes it probable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter VIII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Valabhis, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766.</span><br>
Period Covered.</span> that the Valabhis adopted an era already in use
in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. No other era seems to have
been in use in Valabhi. Three inscriptions have their years dated
expressly in the Valabhi Sam&#803;vat. The earliest of these in
Bhadrak√°li&rsquo;s temple in Somn√°th P√°tan is of
the time of Kum√°rap√°la (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174) the <span class="corr" id="xd25e10766" title="Source: Solanki">Solan&#775;ki</span> ruler of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e10769" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>.
It bears date Valabhi Sam&#803;vat 850. The second and third are in the
temple of Harsata Devi at Ver√°val. The second which was first
mentioned by Colonel Tod, is dated Hijra 662, Vikrama Sam&#803;vat
1320, Valabhi Sam&#803;vat 945, and Sim&#803;ha Sam&#803;vat 151. The
third inscription, in the same temple on the face of the pedestal of an
image of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a represented as upholding the Govardhana
hill, bears date Valabhi <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 927.
These facts prove that an era known as the Valabhi era, which the
inscriptions show began in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319, was
in use for about a hundred years in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. This may be accepted as the era of the Valabhi plates which
extended over two centuries. Further the great authority (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1030) Alberuni gives &#346;aka 241 that is
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319 as the starting point both of the
&lsquo;era of Balah&rsquo; and of what he calls the Guptak√°la or
the Gupta era. Beruni&rsquo;s accuracy is established by a comparison
of the Mandasor inscription and the Nep√°l inscription of
Am&#347;uvarman which together prove the Gupta era started from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319. Though its use by the powerful
Valabhi dynasty caused the era to be generally known by their name in
Gujar√°t in certain localities the Gupta era continued in use
under its original name as in the Morb&iacute; copperplate of
J√°ikadeva which bears date 588 &ldquo;of the era of the
Guptas.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n81.1src" href="#n81.1" name="n81.1src">7</a></p>

K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a by area. Under the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a system the measurement was by
<i>p√°d√°varta</i> literally the space between one foot and
the other that is the modern <i>kadam</i> or pace. The pace used in
measuring land seems to have differed from the ordinary pace as most of
the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a grants mention the
<i>bh&uacute;p√°d√°varta</i> or land pace. The Kaira system
of assessment was by yield the unit being the <i>pi&#7789;aka</i> or
basketful, the grants describing fields as capable of growing so many
baskets of rice or barley (or as requiring so many baskets of seed). As
the grants always specify the Kaira basket a similar system with a
different sized basket seems to have been in use in other parts of the
country. Another detail which the plates preserve is that each field
had its name called after a guardian or from some tree or plant. Among
field names are Kotilaka, Atima&#7751;a-ked√°ra,
Kha&#7751;da-ked√°ra, Gargara-kshetra, Bh&iacute;ma-kshetra,
Khagali-ked√°ra, &#346;ami-ked√°ra.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion.</span>The state religion of the
Valabhi kings was &#346;aivism. Every Valabhi copperplate hitherto
found bears on its seal the figure of a bull with under it the name of
Bha&#7789;√°rka the founder of the dynasty who was a &#346;aiva.
Except Dhruvasena I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526) who is
called <i>Paramabh√°gavata</i> or the great Vaish&#7751;ava and
his brother and successor Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a who is styled
<i>Param√°dityabhakta</i> or the great devotee of the sun, and
Guhasena, who in his grant of Sam&#803;. 248 calls himself
<i>Paramop√°saka</i> or the great devotee of Buddha, all the
Valabhi kings are called <i>Parama-m√°he&#347;vara</i> the great
&#346;aiva.</p>
<p>The grants to Buddhist <i>vih√°ras</i> or monasteries of which
there are several seem special gifts to institutions founded by female
relatives of the granting kings. Most of the grants are to
Br√°hmans who though performing Vaidik ceremonies probably as at
present honoured &#346;aivism. This &#346;aivism seems to have been of
the old P√°&#347;upata school of Nakul&iacute;&#347;a or
Lakul&iacute;&#347;a as the chief shrine of Lakul&iacute;&#347;a was at

and to its pebbles as <i>lin&#775;gas</i> is probably due to the
neighbourhood of this shrine of K√°rv√°n. The followers of
the Nakul&iacute;&#347;a-P√°&#347;upata school were strict
devotees of &#346;aivism, Nakul&iacute;&#347;a the founder being
regarded as an incarnation of &#346;iva. The date of the foundation of
this school is not yet determined. It appears to have been between the
second and the fifth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
Nakul&iacute;&#347;a had four disciples Ku&#347;ika, G√°rgya,
K√°rusha, and Maitreya founders of four branches which spread
through the length and breadth of India. Though no special
representatives of this school remain, in spite of their nominal
allegiance to &#346;ankar√°ch√°rya the
Da&#347;an√°mis or At&iacute;ts are in fact Nakul&iacute;&#347;as
in their discipline doctrines and habits&mdash;applying ashes over the
whole body, planting a <i>lin&#775;ga</i> over the grave of a buried
At&iacute;t, and possessing proprietary rights over &#346;aiva temples.
The P√°&#347;upatas were ever ready to fight for their school and
often helped and served in the armies of kings who became their
disciples. Till a century ago these unpaid followers recruited the
armies of India with celibates firm and strong in fighting. It was
apparently to gain these recruits that so many of the old rulers of
India became followers of the P√°&#347;upata school. To secure
their services the rulers had to pay them special respect. The leaders
of these fighting monks were regarded as pontiffs like the
Bappa-p√°da or Pontiff of the later Valabhi and other kings. Thus
among the later Valabhis &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya IV. is called
<i>B√°vap√°d√°nudhy√°ta</i> and all subsequent
&#346;&iacute;l√°dityas
<i>Bappap√°d√°nudhy√°ta</i> both titles meaning
Worshipping at the feet of <span class="corr" id="xd25e11192" title="Source: Bava">B√°va</span> or Bappa.</p>
<p>This B√°va is the popular Prakrit form of the older Prakrit or
<i>de&#347;&iacute;</i> Bappa meaning Father or worshipful. Bappa is
the original of the Hindust√°ni and Gujar√°ti
B√°v√° father or elder; it is also a special term for a
head Gos√°vi or At&iacute;t or indeed for any recluse. The
epithet <i>Bappa-p√°d√°nudhy√°ta</i>, Bowing at the
feet of Bappa, occurs in the attributes of several Nep√°l kings,
and in the case of king Vasantasena appears the full phrase:</p>
<div class="q xd25e5034">
<p class="first"><i lang="sa-latn">Parama-daivata-bappa-bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka-mah√°r√°ja-&#346;r&iacute;-p√°d√°nudhy√°ta.</i></p>
<p>Falling at the illustrious feet of the great Mah√°r√°ja
Lord Bappa.</p>
</div>
<p>These Nep√°l kings were &#346;aivas as they are called
<i>parama-m√°he&#347;vara</i> in the text of the inscription and
like the Valabhi seals their seals bear a bull. It follows that the
term <i>Bappa</i> was applied both by the Valabhis and the Nep√°l
kings to some one, who can hardly be the same individual, unless he was
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Religion.</span> common overlord, which the distance between the two
countries and still more the fact that his titles are the same as the
titles of the Valabhi kings make almost impossible. In these
circumstances the most probable explanation of the Bappa or B√°va
of these inscriptions is that it was applied to Shaivite pontiffs or
ecclesiastical dignitaries. The attribute <i>Parama-daivata</i> The
Great Divine prefixed to Bappa in the inscription of Vasantasena
confirms this view. That such royal titles as
<i>Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja</i>,
<i>Paramabha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka</i>, and <i>Parame&#347;vara</i>
are ascribed to Bappa is in agreement with the present use of
Mah√°r√°ja for all priestly Br√°hmans and recluses
and of Bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka for Digambara Jain priests. Though
specially associated with &#346;aivas the title <i>bappa</i> is applied
also to Vaishnava dignitaries. That the term <i>bappa</i> was in
similar use among the Buddhists appears from the title of a Valabhi
<i>vih√°ra</i> Bappap√°d&iacute;yavih√°ra The
monastery of the worshipful Bappa that is Of the great teacher
Sthiramati by whom it was built.<a class="noteref" id="n85.1src" href="#n85.1" name="n85.1src">14</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin of the Valabhis.</span>The tribe or
race of Bha&#7789;√°rka the founder of the Valabhi dynasty is
doubtful. None of the numerous Valabhi copperplates mentions the race
of the founder. The Chalukya and R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a
copperplates are silent regarding the Valabhi dynasty. And it is worthy
of note that the Gehlots and Gohils, who are descended from the
Valabhis, take their name not from their race but from king Guha or
Guhasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;559&ndash;567) the fourth
ruler and apparently the first great sovereign among the Valabhis.
These considerations make it probable that Bha&#7789;√°rka
belonged to some low or stranger tribe. Though the evidence falls short
of proof the probability seems strong that Bha&#7789;√°rka
belonged to the Gurjara tribe, and that it was the supremacy of him and
his descendants which gave rise to the name Gurjjara-r√°tra the
country of the Gurjjaras, a name used at first by outsiders and
afterwards adopted by the people of Gujar√°t. Except
Bha&#7789;√°rka and his powerful dynasty no kings occur of
sufficient importance to have given their name to the great province of
Gujar√°t. Against their Gurjara origin it may be urged that the
Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640)
calls the king of Valabhi a Kshatriya. Still Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s
remark was made more than a century after the establishment of the
dynasty when their rise to power and influence had made it possible for
them to ennoble themselves by calling themselves Kshatriyas and tracing
their lineage to <span class="corr" id="xd25e11285" title="Source: Puranic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> heroes. That such
ennobling was not only possible but common is beyond question. Many
so-called R√°jput families in Gujar√°t and <span class="corr" id="xd25e11288" title="Source: K√°thiav√°&#7693;a">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>
can be traced to low or stranger tribes. The early kings of
N√°ndipur&iacute; or N√°ndod (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450) call themselves Gurjjaras and the later
members of the same dynasty trace their lineage to the
Mah√°bh√°rata hero Kar&#7751;a. Again two of the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e11295" title="Source: Nandod">N√°ndod</span> Gurjjaras Dadda II. and
<span class="corr" id="xd25e11298" title="Source: Jayabhata">Jayabha&#7789;a</span> II. helped the Valabhis
under circumstances which suggest that the bond of sympathy

Chapter VIII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Valabhis, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766.</span><br>

present chiefs of N√°ndod derive their lineage from Kar&#7751;a
and call themselves Gohils of the same stock as the Bh√°vnagar
Gohils who admittedly belong to the Valabhi stock. This supports the
theory that the Gurjjaras and the Valabhis had a common origin, and
that the Gurjjaras were a branch of and tributary to the Valabhis. This
would explain how the Valabhis came to make grants in Broach at the
time when the Gurjjaras ruled there. It would further explain that the
Gurjjaras were called <i>s√°mantas</i> or feudatories because
they were under the overlordship of the Valabhis.<a class="noteref" id="n86.1src" href="#n86.1" name="n86.1src">15</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">History.</span>The preceding chapter shows

Kum√°ragupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;416) and
Skandagupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;456) none of the Guptas

K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Of what happened in
Gujar√°t during the forty years after Gupta 150 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;469), when the reign of Skandagupta came to an
end nothing is known or is likely to be discovered from Indian sources.
The blank of forty years to the founder Bha&#7789;√°rka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509) or more correctly of sixty
years to Dhruvasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526) the first
Valabhi king probably corresponds with the ascendancy of some foreign
dynasty or tribe. All trace of this tribe has according to custom been
blotted out of the Sanskrit and other Hindu records. At the same time
it is remarkable that the fifty years ending about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;525 correspond closely with the ascendancy in
north and north-west India of the great tribe of Ephthalites or White
Huns. As has been shown in the Gupta Chapter, by <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470 or 480, the White Huns seem to have been
powerful if not supreme in Upper India. In the beginning of the sixth
century, perhaps about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;520, Cosmas
Indikopleustes describes the north of India and the west coast as far
south as Kalliena that is Kaly√°n near Bombay as under the Huns

or Gurjjara king. His coins were continued so long in use and were so
often copied that in the end upright strokes took the place of letters.
That these coins did not belong to the founder of the Valabhi dynasty
appears not only from the difference of name between
Bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka and Bha&#7789;√°rka but because the
coiner was a king and the founder of the Valabhis a general.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sen√°pati Bha&#7789;√°rka,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;520&nbsp;?</span>Of the

following details are given in one of his epithets in Valabhi
copperplates: &lsquo;Who obtained glory by dealing hundreds of blows on
the large and very mighty armies of the Maitrakas, who by <span class="marginnote">The Maitrakas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;509.</span>force had subdued their
enemies.&rsquo; As regards these Maitrakas it is to be noted that the
name Maitraka means Solar. The sound of the compound epithet
<i>Maitraka-amitra</i> that is Maitraka-enemy used in the inscription
makes it probable that the usual form Mihira or solar was rejected in
favour of Maitraka which also means solar to secure the necessary
assonance with <i>amitra</i> or enemy. The form Mihira solar seems a
Hinduizing or meaning-making of the northern tribal name Me&#7693;h or
Mehr, the Mehrs being a tribe which at one time seem to have held sway
over the whole of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and which are
still found in strength near the Barda hills in the south-west of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.<a class="noteref" id="n87.1src"
href="#n87.1" name="n87.1src">17</a> The Jethv√° chiefs of
Porbandar who were formerly powerful rulers are almost certainly of the
Mehr tribe. They are still called Mehr kings and the Mehrs of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a regard them as their leaders and
at the call of their Head are ready to fight for him. The chief of Mehr
traditions describes the fights of their founder Makaradhvaja with one
May&uacute;radhvaja. This tradition seems to embody the memory of an
historical struggle. The <i>makara</i> or fish is the tribal badge of
the Mehrs and is marked on a Morb&iacute; copperplate dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;904 (G. 585) and on the forged
Dh&iacute;n&iacute;ki grant of the Mehr king
J√°&iacute;k√°deva. On the other hand May&uacute;radhvaja
or peacock-bannered would be the name of the Guptas beginning with
Chandragupta who ruled in Gujar√°t (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;396&ndash;416) and whose coins have a peacock on
the reverse. The tradition would thus be a recollection of the struggle
between the Mehrs and Guptas in which about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470 the Guptas were defeated. The Mehrs seem to
have been a northern tribe, who, the evidence of place names seems to

<p>The above account of the founder of the Valabhis accepts the
received opinion that he was the Sen√°pati or General of the
Guptas. The two chief points in support of this view are that the
Valabhis adopted both the Gupta era and the Gupta currency. Still it is
to be noted that this adoption of a previous era and currency by no
means implies any connection with the former rulers.<a class="noteref"

practice of continuing the existing type is by no means
uncommon.<a class="noteref" id="n88.2src" href="#n88.2" name="n88.2src">19</a> In these circumstances, and seeing that certain of

Dharasena (2) Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha (3) Dhruvasena and (4)
Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a. Of Dharasena the first son no record has been
traced. His name first appears in the copperplates of his brother
Dhruvasena where like his father he is called Sen√°pati.
Similarly of the second son Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha no record exists
except in the copperplates of his brother Dhruvasena. In these
copperplates unlike his father and elder brother Dhruvasena is called
<i>Mah√°r√°ja</i> and is mentioned as &lsquo;invested with
royal authority in person by the great lord, the lord of the wide
extent of the whole world.&rsquo; This great lord or
<i>paramasv√°mi</i> could not have been his father
Bha&#7789;√°rka. Probably he was the king to whom
Bha&#7789;√°rka owed allegiance. It is not clear where
Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha was installed king probably it was in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a from the south-east of which his

Dhruvasena&rsquo;s attributes <i lang="sa-latn">Parama-bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka-p√°d√°nudhy√°ta</i>,
Bowing at the feet of the great lord, apparently applies to the same
paramount sovereign who installed his brother Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha.
The paramount lord can hardly be Dhruvasena&rsquo;s father as his
father is either called <i>Bha&#7789;√°rka</i> without the
<i>parama</i> or more commonly <i>Sen√°pati</i> that is general.
Dhruvasena&rsquo;s other political attributes are
<i>Mah√°r√°ja</i> Great King or
<i>Mah√°s&uacute;manta</i> Great Chief, the usual titles of a
petty feudatory king. In the <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;535
plates he has the further attributes of
<i>Mah√°prat&iacute;h√°ra</i> the great doorkeeper or
chamberlain, <i lang="sa-latn">Mah√°da&#7751;&#7693;an√°yaka</i><a class="noteref" id="n89.3src" href="#n89.3" name="n89.3src">23</a> the great
magistrate, and <i lang="sa-latn">M√°h√°k√°rtakritika</i> (?) or great
general, titles which seem to show he still served some overlord. It is
not clear whether Dhruvasena succeeded his brother
Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha or was a separate contemporary ruler. The
absence of &lsquo;falling at the feet of&rsquo; or other successional
phrase and the use of the epithet &lsquo;serving at the feet of&rsquo;
the great lord seem to show that his power was distinct from his
brothers. In any case Dhruvasena is the first of the family who has a
clear connection with Valabhi from which the grants of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526 and 529 are dated.</p>
<p>In these grants Dhruvasena&rsquo;s father Bha&#7789;√°rka and
his elder brothers are described as &lsquo;great
M√°he&#347;varas&rsquo; that is followers of &#346;iva, while
Dhruvasena himself is called <i>Paramabh√°gavata</i> the great
Vaish&#7751;ava. It is worthy of note, as stated in the <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;535 grant, that his niece
Du&#7693;&#7693;√° (or Lul√°?) was a Buddhist and had
dedicated a Buddhist monastery at Valabhi. The latest known date of
Dhruvasena is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;535 (G. 216). Whether
Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a or Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a&rsquo;s son Guhasena
succeeded is doubtful. That Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a is styled
Mah√°r√°ja and that a twenty-four years&rsquo; gap occurs
between the latest grant of Dhruvasena and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;559 the earliest grant of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>

Guhasena favour the succession of Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a. On the other
hand in the <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;559 grant all
Guhasena&rsquo;s sins are said to be cleansed by falling at the feet

again risen to power.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Guhasena, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;539&ndash;569.</span>Of Guhasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;539?&ndash;569) three plates and a fragment of an
inscription remain. Two of the grants are from Val&#803;eh dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;559 and 565 (G. 240 and 246)<a class="noteref" id="n90.1src" href="#n90.1" name="n90.1src">24</a>: the third

with Guhasena who seems to have been the first great ruler of his
dynasty. Guhasena is a Sanskrit name meaning Whose army is like that of
K√°rttika-sv√°mi: his popular name was probably Guhila. It
appears probable that the Gohil and Gehlot <span class="corr" id="xd25e11700" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> chiefs of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e11703" title="Source: K√°thi√°va&#7693;a">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>
and R√°jput√°na, who are believed to be descendants of the
Valabhis, take their name from Guhasena or Guha, the form Gehloti or
Gehlot, <i>Guhila-utta</i>, being a corruption of Guhilaputra or
descendants of Guhila, a name which occurs in old <span class="corr"
id="xd25e11709" title="Source: R√°jp&uacute;t">R√°jput</span> records.<a class="noteref" id="n90.4src" href="#n90.4" name="n90.4src">27</a> This lends
support to the view that Guhasena was believed to be the first king of
the dynasty. Like his predecessors he is called Mah√°r√°ja
or great king. In one grant he is called the great &#346;aiva and in
another the great Buddhist devotee (<i>paramop√°saka</i>), while
he grants villages to the Buddhist monastery of his paternal
aunt&rsquo;s daughter Du&#7693;&#7693;√°. Though a &#346;aivite
Guhasena, like most of his predecessors, tolerated and even encouraged
Buddhism. His minister of peace and war is named Skandabha&#7789;a.</p>
<p>The beginning of Guhasena&rsquo;s reign is uncertain. Probably it
was not earlier than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;539 (G. 220).
His latest known date is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;567 (G. 248)
but he may have reigned two years longer.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dharasena II. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;569&ndash;589.</span>About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;569 (G. 250) Guhasena was succeeded by his son
Dharasena II. Five of his grants remain, three dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;571 (G. 252),<a class="noteref" id="n90.5src"

Dharasena is called Mah√°r√°ja or great king; in the two

Dharasena had to acknowledge as overlord some one whose power had

<p>The &#346;atru&ntilde;jaya M√°h√°tmya has a prophetic

comparatively modern and is not worthy of much trust. Vikrama
Sam&#803;vat 477 would be <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;420 when no
Valabhi kingdom was established and no &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya can
have flourished. If the date 477 has been rightly preserved, and it be
taken in the &#346;aka era it would correspond with Gupta 237 or
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;556, that is thirty to forty years
before &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya&rsquo;s reign. Although no reliance
can be placed on the date still his second name Dharm√°ditya
gives support to his identification with the
&#346;&iacute;l√°ditya of the M√°h√°tmya.</p>
<p>His grants like many of his predecessors style
&#346;&iacute;l√°ditya a great devotee of &#346;iva. Still that
two of his three known grants were made to Buddhist monks shows that he
tolerated and respected Buddhism. The writer of one of the grants is
mentioned as the minister of peace and war Chandrabha&#7789;&#7789;i;
the D&uacute;taka or causer of the gift in two of the Buddhist grants
is Bha&#7789;&#7789;a &Aacute;dityaya&#347;as apparently some military
officer. The third grant, to a temple of &#346;iva, has for its
D&uacute;taka the illustrious Kharagraha apparently the brother and
successor of the king.</p>
<p>&#346;&iacute;l√°ditya&rsquo;s reign probably began about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;594 (G. 275). His latest grant is
dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;609 (G. 290).<a class="noteref"

brother &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya who probably retired from the

Dhruvasena is probably a Sanskritised form of the popular but

before the time when (640) Hiuen Tsiang is calculated to have been in
M√°lwa if not actually at Valabhi. If one of Dhruvasena&rsquo;s
poetic attributes is not mere hyperbole, he made conquests and spread
the power of Valabhi. On the other hand the Navs√°ri grant of
Jayabha&#7789;a III. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;706&ndash;734)
the Gurjjara king of Broach states that Dadda II. of Broach

Dharasena IV. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640&ndash;649.</span>
Two of Dharasena IV.&rsquo;s grants remain, one dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;645 (G. 326) the other <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;649 (G. 330). A grant of his father Dhruvasena

copperplate in the possession of the chief of Morb&iacute; belonging to
his successor Dhruvasena III. dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;651 (G. 332) prove that Dharasena&rsquo;s reign
did not last more than seventeen years. The well known Sanskrit poem
Bha&#7789;&#7789;ik√°vya seems to have been composed in the reign
of this king as at the end of his work the author says it was written
at Valabhi protected (governed) by the king the illustrious
Dharasena.<a class="noteref" id="n92.1src" href="#n92.1" name="n92.1src">34</a> The author&rsquo;s application to Dharasena of the
title <i>Narendra</i> Lord of Men is a further proof of his great
power.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dhruvasena III. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;650&ndash;656.</span>Dharasena IV. was not
succeeded by his son but by Dhruvasena the son of Derabha&#7789;a the
son of Dharasena IV.&rsquo;s paternal grand-uncle. Derabha&#7789;a
appears not to have been ruler of Valabhi itself but of some district
in the south of the Valabhi territory. His epithets describe him as
like the royal sage Agastya spreading to the south, and as the lord of
the earth which has for its two breasts the Sahya and Vindhya hills.
This description may apply to part of the province south of Kaira where
the Sahy√°dri and Vindhya mountains may be said to unite. In the
absence of a male heir in the direct line, Derabha&#7789;a&rsquo;s son
Dhruvasena appears to have succeeded to the throne of Valabhi. The only
known copperplate of Dhruvasena III.&rsquo;s, dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;651 (G. 332), records the grant of the village of
Pe&#7693;hapadra in Vanthali, the modern Vanthali in the
Nav√°nagar State of North K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.
A copperplate of his elder brother and successor Kharagraha dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;656 (G. 337) shows that
Dhruvasena&rsquo;s reign cannot have lasted over six years.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kharagraha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;656&ndash;665.</span>The less than usually
complimentary and respectful reference to Dhruvasena III. in the
attributes of Kharagraha suggests that Kharagraha took the kingdom by
force from his younger brother as the rightful successor of his father.
At all events the succession of Kharagraha to Dhruvasena was not in the
usual peaceful manner. Kharagraha&rsquo;s grant dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;656 (G. 337) is written by the Divirapati or

Valabhi copperplate is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;766 the
expedition must have taken place between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750 and 770. In support of the Hindu tradition of
an expedition from Mans&uacute;ra against Valabhi between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750 and 770 it is to be noted that the Arab
historians of Sindh record that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;758 (H. 140) the Khalif Mans&uacute;r sent Amru
bin Jamal with a fleet of barks to the coast of Barada.<a class="noteref" id="n95.3src" href="#n95.3" name="n95.3src">44</a> Twenty
years later <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;776 (H. 160) a second
expedition succeeded in taking the town, but, as sickness broke out,
they had to return. The question remains should the word, which in
these extracts Elliot reads Barada, be read Balaba. The lax rules of
Arab cursive writing would cause little difficulty in adopting the
reading Balaba.<a class="noteref" id="n95.4src" href="#n95.4" name="n95.4src">45</a> Further it is hard to believe that Valabhi, though to
some extent sheltered by its distance from the coast and probably a
place of less importance than its chroniclers describe, should be
unknown to the Arab raiders of the seventh and eighth centuries and
after its fall be known to Alberuni in the eleventh century. At the

may have been,<a class="noteref" id="n95.5src" href="#n95.5" name="n95.5src">46</a> a town Barada on the south-west coast of

historians<a class="noteref" id="n96.1src" href="#n96.1" name="n96.1src">47</a> that at this time the Sindh Arabs also made a naval
expedition against Kandah√°r seems in agreement with the
traditional account in Tod that after the destruction of Valabhi the
rulers retired to a fort near Cambay from which after a few years they
were driven.<a class="noteref" id="n96.2src" href="#n96.2" name="n96.2src">48</a> If this fort is the Kandah√°r of the Sindh

The Importance of Valabhi, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750&ndash;770.</span> origin of the city and of
its rulers, the extent of their sway, and the cause and date of their
overthrow are all uncertain. The unfitness of the site, the want of
reservoirs or other stone remains, the uncertainty when its rulers
gained an independent position, the fact that only one of them claimed
the title <i>Chakravarti</i> or All Ruler are hardly consistent with
any far-reaching authority. Add to this the continuance of Maitraka or
Mer power in North K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, the
separateness though perhaps dependence of Saur√°sh&#7789;ra even
in the time of Valabhi&rsquo;s greatest power,<a class="noteref" id="n97.1src" href="#n97.1" name="n97.1src">52</a> the rare mention of

during the ten years ending 650, Valabhi was ever of more than local
importance.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Valabhi and the Gehlots.</span>In
connection with the pride of the Sesodias or Gohils of
Mew√°&#7693; in their Valabhi origin<a class="noteref" id="n97.3src" href="#n97.3" name="n97.3src">54</a> the question who were
the Valabhis has a special interest. The text shows that Pandit
Bhagv√°nl√°l was of opinion the Valabhis were Gurjjaras.
The text also notes that the Pandit believed they reached south-east
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a by sea from near Broach and that
if they did not come to Broach from M√°lwa at least the early
rulers obtained (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;520 and 526)
investiture from the M√°lwa kings. Apart from the doubtful
evidence of an early second to fifth century B√°la or Valabhi
three considerations weigh against the theory that the Valabhis entered
Gujar√°t from M√°lwa in the sixth century. First their
acceptance of the Gupta era and of the Gupta currency raises the
presumption that the Valabhis were in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a during Gupta ascendancy
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;440&ndash;480): Second that the
Sesodias trace their pedigree through Valabhi to an earlier settlement
at Dh√°nk in south-west K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and
that the V√°las of Dh√°nk still hold the place of heads of
the V√°las of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a: And Third
that both Sesodias and V√°las trace their origin to Kanaksen a
second century North Indian immigrant into
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a combine to raise the presumption
that the V√°las were in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
before the historical founding of Valabhi in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526<a class="noteref" id="n97.4src" href="#n97.4"

founders the V√°las or <span class="corr" id="xd25e12920" title="Source: B√°l√°s">B√°las</span>.</p>
<p>Whether or not the ancestors of the Gohils and V√°las were

correctness of the R√°jput traditions and the Jain records that
the Gohils or Sesodias of Mew√°&#7693; came from B√°la or
Valabhi in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Such a withdrawal
from the coast, the result of the terror of Arab raids, is in agreement
with the fact that from about the middle of the eighth century the
rulers of Gujar√°t established an inland capital at <span class="corr" id="xd25e12944" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;746).<a class="noteref" id="n98.1src" href="#n98.1" name="n98.1src">56</a> It is further in
agreement with the establishment by the Gohil refugees of a town Balli
in Mew√°&#7693;; with the continuance as late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;968 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1024)

how far can the half-poetic accounts of the Sesodias be reconciled with
a date for the fall of Valabhi so late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;766. The mythical wanderings, the caveborn Guha,
and his rule at Idar can be easily spared. The name Gehlot which the
Sesodias trace to the caveborn Guha may as the Bh√°vnagar Gehlots
hold have its origin in Guhasena (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;559&ndash;567) perhaps the first Valabhi chief of

<p><span class="marginnote">The V√°las and
K√°this.</span>If from the first and not solely since the fall of
Valabhi the V√°las have been associated with the K√°this it
seems best to suppose they held to the K√°this a position like
that of the Jetwas to their followers the Mers. According to
Tod<a class="noteref" id="n100.2src" href="#n100.2" name="n100.2src">73</a> both V√°las and K√°this claim the title
<i>Tata Mult√°nka Rai</i> Lords of Tata and Mult√°n. The
accounts of the different sackings of Valabhi are too confused and the
traces of an earlier settlement too scanty and doubtful to justify any
attempt to carry back Valabhi and the V√°las beyond the Maitraka
overthrow of Gupta power in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;480). The boast that
Bha&#7789;√°rka, the reputed founder of the house of Valabhi
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509), had obtained glory by dealing
hundreds of blows on the large and very mighty armies of the Maitrakas
who by force had subdued their enemies, together with the fact that the
Valabhis did and the Maitrakas did not adopt the Gupta era and currency
seem to show the V√°las were settled in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a at an earlier date than the Mers
and Jetwas. That is, if the identification is correct, the V√°las
and K√°this were in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a before
the first wave of the White Huns approached. It has been noticed above
under Skandagupta that the enemies, or some of the enemies, with whom,
in the early years of his reign <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;452&ndash;454, Skandagupta had so fierce a
struggle were still in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;456 a source
of anxiety and required the control of a specially able viceroy at
Jun√°ga&#7693;h. Since no trace of the K√°this appears in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a legends or traditions before the
fifth century the suggestion may be offered that under V√°la or
B√°la leadership the K√°this were among the enemies who on
the death of Kum√°ragupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;454)
seized the Gupta possessions in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.

These fire symbols, though in the main Indo-Skythian, betray from about
the sixth century a more direct Sassanian influence. The use of similar
coins coupled with their common sun worship seems sufficient to explain
how the Agnikulas and other K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and

or other earlier writers it is a mistaken form due to some
copyist&rsquo;s confusion with the later name Bahlika. As used by
P√°&#7751;ini the name B√°hika applied to certain
Panj√°b tribes seems a general term meaning Outsider a view which
is supported by Brian Hodgson&rsquo;s identification of the
Mah√°bh√°rata B√°hikas with the Bahings one of the
outcaste or broken tribes of Nep√°l.<a class="noteref" id="n104.1src" href="#n104.1" name="n104.1src">97</a> The use of
B√°hika in the Mah√°bh√°rata would then be due either
to the wish to identify new tribes with old or to the temptation to use
a word which had a suitable meaning in Sanskrit. If then there is fair
ground for holding that the correct form of the name in the
Mah√°bh√°rata is B√°lhika and that B√°lhika
means men of Balkh the question remains which of the different waves of
Central Asian invaders in the centuries before and after Christ are
most likely to have adopted or to have received the title of Baktrians.
Between the second century before and the third century after Christ
two sets of northerners might justly have claimed or have received the
title of Baktrians. These northerners are the Baktrian Greeks about
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;180 and the Yuechi between
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;20 and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300. Yavana is so favourite a name among Indian
writers that it may be accepted that whatever other northern tribes the
name Yavana includes no name but Yavana passed into use for the
Baktrian Greeks. Their long peaceful and civilised rule (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;130&ndash;<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;300&nbsp;?) from their capital at Balkh entitles
the Yuechi to the name Baktrians or B√°hlikas. That the Yuechi
were known in India as Baktrians is proved by the writer of the
Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247), who, when Baktria was
still under Yuechi rule, speaks of the Baktrianoi as a most warlike
race governed by their own sovereign.<a class="noteref" id="n104.2src"
href="#n104.2" name="n104.2src">98</a> It is known that in certain
cases the Yuechi tribal names were of local origin. Kush√°n the
name of the leading tribe is according to some authorities a
place-name.<a class="noteref" id="n104.3src" href="#n104.3" name="n104.3src">99</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"

one of the tribes who about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;50 joined
under the head of the Kush√°ns were taken from the lands where
they had settled. It is therefore in agreement both with the movements
and with the practice of the Yuechi, that, on reaching India, a portion
of them should be known as B√°hlikas or B√°lhikas. Though
the evidence falls short of proof there seems fair reason to suggest
that the present <span class="corr" id="xd25e13643" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> and K√°thi V√°las or

through a Sanskritised V√°hlika, may be traced to some section of
the Yuechi, who, as they passed south from Baktria, between the first
century before and the fourth century after Christ, assumed or received
the title of men of Balkh.</p>
<p>One collateral point seems to deserve notice. St. Martin<a class="noteref" id="n105.1src" href="#n105.1" name="n105.1src">100</a> says:
&lsquo;The Greek historians do not show the least trace of the name
B√°hlika.&rsquo; Accepting B√°hika, with the general sense
of Outsider, as the form used by Indian writers before the Christian
era and remembering<a class="noteref" id="n105.2src" href="#n105.2"
name="n105.2src">101</a> P√°&#7751;ini&rsquo;s description of the
M√°lavas and Kshudrakas as two B√°hika tribes of the
North-West the fact that P√°&#7751;ini lived very shortly before
or after the time of Alexander and was specially acquainted with the
Panj√°b leaves little doubt that when (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;326) Alexander conquered their country the Malloi
and Oxydrakai, that is the M√°lavas and Kshudrakas, were known as
B√°hikas. Seeing that Alexander&rsquo;s writers were specially
interested in and acquainted with the Malloi and Oxydrakai it is
strange if St. Martin is correct in stating that Greek writings show no
trace of the name B√°hika. In explanation of this difficulty the
following suggestion may be offered.<a class="noteref" id="n105.3src"
href="#n105.3" name="n105.3src">102</a> As the Greeks sounded their
<i>kh</i> (<span class="trans" title="ch"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&chi;</span></span>) as a spirant, the Indian B√°hika would
strike them as almost the exact equivalent of their own word
<span class="trans" title="bakchikos"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&beta;&alpha;&kappa;&chi;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>.
More than one of Alexander&rsquo;s writers has curious references to a
Bacchic element in the Panj√°b tribes. Arrian<a class="noteref"
id="n105.4src" href="#n105.4" name="n105.4src">103</a> notices that, as
Alexander&rsquo;s fleet passed down the Jhelum, the people lined the
banks chanting songs taught them by Dionysus and the Bacchantes.
According to Quintus Curtius<a class="noteref" id="n105.5src" href="#n105.5" name="n105.5src">104</a> the name of Father Bacchus was
famous among the people to the south of the Malloi. These references
are vague. But Strabo is definite.<a class="noteref" id="n105.6src"
href="#n105.6" name="n105.6src">105</a> The Malloi and Oxydrakai are
reported to be the descendants of Bacchus. This passage is the more
important since Strabo&rsquo;s use of the writings of Aristobulus
Alexander&rsquo;s historian and of Onesikritos Alexander&rsquo;s pilot
and Br√°hman-interviewer gives his details a special
value.<a class="noteref" id="n105.7src" href="#n105.7" name="n105.7src">106</a> It may be said Strabo explains why the Malloi and
Oxydrakai were called Bacchic and Strabo&rsquo;s explanation is not in
agreement with the proposed B√°hika origin. The answer is that
Strabo&rsquo;s explanation can be proved to be in part, if not
altogether, fictitious. Strabo<a class="noteref" id="n105.8src" href="#n105.8" name="n105.8src">107</a> gives two reasons why the Oxydrakai

Chapter VIII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Valabhis, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766.</span><br>
V√°las.</span> were called Bacchic. First because the vine grew
among them and second because their kings marched forth
<i>Bakkhik&ocirc;s</i> that is after the Bacchic manner. It is
difficult to prove that in the time of Alexander the vine did not grow
in the Panj√°b. Still the fact that the vines of Nysa near
Jal√°l√°b√°d and of the hill Meros are mentioned by
several writers and that no vines are referred to in the Greek accounts
of the Panj√°b suggests that the vine theory is an
after-thought.<a class="noteref" id="n106.1src" href="#n106.1" name="n106.1src">108</a> Strabo&rsquo;s second explanation, the Bacchic pomp
of their kings, can be more completely disproved. The evidence that
neither the Malloi nor the Oxydrakai had a king is abundant.<a class="noteref" id="n106.2src" href="#n106.2" name="n106.2src">109</a> That
the Greeks knew the Malloi and Oxydrakai were called Bakkhikoi and that
they did not know why they had received that name favours the view that
the explanation lies in the Indian name B√°hika. One point
remains. Does any trace of the original B√°hikas or Outsiders
survive? In Cutch K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and North
Gujar√°t are two tribes of half settled cattle-breeders and
shepherds whose names Rahb√°ris as if Rah√°baher and
Bharv√°ds as if Baherv√°da seem like B√°hika to mean
Outsider. Though in other respects both classes appear to have adopted
ordinary Hindu practices the conduct of the Bharv√°d women of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a during their special marriage
seasons bears a curiously close resemblance to certain of the details
in the Mah√°bh√°rata account of the B√°hika women.
Colonel Barton writes:<a class="noteref" id="n106.3src" href="#n106.3"
name="n106.3src">110</a> &lsquo;The great marriage festival of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Bharv√°ds which is held

butter. Under the exciting influence of the butter the women become
frantic singing obscene songs breaking down hedges and spoiling the
surrounding crops.&rsquo; Though the Bharv√°ds are so long
settled in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a as to be considered

Gavrishankar, N√°ib Div√°n of Bh√°vnagar, has made a
collection of articles found in Valabhi. The collection includes clay
seals of four varieties and of about the seventh century with the
Buddhist formula <i>Ye Dh√°rma hetu Prabhav√°</i>: a small
earthen tope with the same formula imprinted on its base with a seal;
beads and ring stones <i>nangs</i> of several varieties of <i>akik</i>
or carnelian and <i>sphatik</i> or coral some finished others half
finished showing that as in modern Cambay the polishing of carnelians
was a leading industry in early Valabhi. One circular figure of the
size of a half rupee carved in black stone has engraved upon it the
letters <i>ma ro</i> in characters of about the second
century.<a class="noteref" id="n78.asrc" href="#n78.a" name="n78.asrc">2</a> A royal seal found by Colonel Watson in Val&#803;eh
bears on it an imperfect inscription of four lines in characters as old
as Dhruvasena I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526). This seal
contains the names of three generations of kings, two of which the
grandfather and grandson read Ahivarmman and <span class="corr" id="xd25e10583" title="Source: Pushy&acirc;&#7751;a">Pushy√°&#7751;a</span> all three
being called <i>Mah√°r√°ja</i> or great king. The dynastic
name is lost. The names on these moveable objects need not belong to
Valabhi history. Still that seals of the second and fifth centuries
have been discovered in Valabhi shows the place was in existence before
the founding of the historical Valabhi kingdom. A further proof of the
age of the city is the mention of it in the
Kath√°sarit-s√°gara a comparatively modern work but of very
old materials. To this evidence of age, with much hesitation, may be
added Balai Ptolemy&rsquo;s name for Gopn√°th point which
suggests that as early as the second century Val&#803;eh or Baleh
(compare Alberuni&rsquo;s era of Balah) was known by its present name.
Badly minted coins of the Gupta ruler Kum√°ragupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;417&ndash;453) are so common as to suggest that
they were the currency of Valabhi.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n78.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

temple of &Aacute;din√°tha, the wick of the lamp in the shrine
was removed by mice and set on fire and almost destroyed the temple
which was wholly of wood. The minister seeing the danger of wooden
buildings determined to erect a stone edifice
(<i>Kum√°rap√°la Charita</i>). The story about
Soman√°tha is given in an inscription of the time of
Kum√°rap√°la in the temple of Bhadrak√°li which shows
that before the stone temple was built by Bh&iacute;madeva I.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1022&ndash;1072) the structure was
of wood which was traditionally believed to be as old as the time of

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n83.1"
href="#n83.1src" name="n83.1">13</a></span> K√°rv√°n seems
to have suffered great desecration at the hands of the
Musalm√°ns. All round the village chiefly under pipal trees,
images and pieces of sculpture and large <i>lin&#775;gas</i> lie
scattered. To the north and east of the village on the banks of a large
built pond called K√°&#347;&iacute;ku&#7751;&#7693;a are numerous
sculptures and <i>lin&#775;gas</i>. Partly embedded in the ground a
pillar in style of about the eleventh century has a writing over it of
latter times. The inscription contains the name of the place
Sanskritised as K√°y√°varohana, and mentions an ascetic
named V&iacute;rabahadrar√°&#347;i who remained mute for twelve
years. Near the pillar, at the steps leading to the water, is a carved
doorway of about the tenth or eleventh century with some
well-proportioned figures. The left doorpost has at the top a figure of
&#346;iva, below the &#346;iva a figure of S&uacute;rya, below the
S&uacute;rya a male and female, and under them attendants or
<i>ga&#7751;as</i> of &#346;iva. The right doorpost has at the top a
figure of Vish&#7751;u seated on Garu&#7693;a, below the seated
<span class="corr" id="xd25e11135" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span> a standing Vish&#7751;u with four
hands, and below that two sitting male and female figures, the male
with hands folded in worship the female holding a purse. These figures
probably represent a married pair who paid for this gateway. Further
below are figures of <i>ga&#7751;as</i> of &#346;iva. In 1884 in
repairing the south bank of the pond a number of carved stones were
brought from the north of the town. About half a mile north-west of the
town on the bank of a dry brook, is a temple of Ch√°mund√°
Dev&iacute; of about the tenth century. It contains a mutilated
life-size image of Ch√°mund√°. Facing the temple lie
mutilated figures of the seven M√°trik√°s and of Bhairava,
probably the remains of a separate altar facing the temple with the
<i>m√°tri-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</i> or Mother-Meeting upon it. The
village has a large modern temple of &#346;iva called Nakle&#347;vara,
on the site of some old temple and mostly built of old carved temple
stones. In the temple close by are a number of old images of the sun
and the boar incarnation of <span class="corr" id="xd25e11147" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span> all of about the tenth or eleventh
century. The name Nakle&#347;vara would seem to have been derived from
Nakuli&#347;a the founder of the P√°&#347;upata sect and the
temple may originally have had an image of Nakuli&#347;a himself or a
<i>lin&#775;ga</i> representing Nakul&iacute;&#347;a. Close to the west
of the village near a small dry reservoir called the Ku&#7751;&#7693;a
of R√°jar√°je&#347;vara lies a well-preserved black stone
seated figure of Cha&#7751;&#7693;a one of the most respected of
&#346;iva&rsquo;s attendants, without whose worship all worship of
&#346;iva is imperfect, and to whom all that remains after making
oblations to &#346;iva is offered. A number of other sculptures lie on
the bank of the pond. About a mile to the south of K√°rv√°n
is a village called Lingthali the place of
<i>lin&#775;gas</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n83.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

or were not Gurjjaras the following facts favour the view that they
entered Gujar√°t from M√°lwa. It has been shown (Fleet
<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XX. 376) that while the
Guptas used the so-called Northern year beginning with Chaitra, the
Valabhi year began with K√°rtika (see <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XX. 376). And further Kielhorn in
his examination of questions connected with the Vikrama era
(<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIX. and XX.) has
given reasons for believing that the original Vikrama year began with
K√°rtika and took its rise in M√°lwa. It seems therefore
that when they settled in Gujar√°t, while they adopted the Gupta
era the Valabhis still adhered to the old arrangement of the year to
which they had been accustomed in their home in M√°lwa. The
arrangement of the year entered into every detail of their lives, and
was therefore much more difficult to change than the starting point of
their era, which was important only for official acts.&mdash;(A. M. T.

Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha&rsquo;s investiture is about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;520 it is necessary to consider what kings at
this period claimed the title of supreme lord and could boast of ruling
the whole earth. The rulers of this period whom we know of are
Mihirakula, Ya&#347;odharman Vish&#7751;uvardhana, the descendants of
Kum√°ragupta&rsquo;s son Puragupta, and the Gupta chiefs of
Eastern M√°lwa. Neither Toram√°&#7751;a nor Mihirakula
appears to have borne the paramount title of Parame&#347;vara though
the former is called Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja in the
Era&#7751; inscription and Avanipati or Lord of the Earth (= simply
king) on his coins: in the Gw√°lior inscription Mihirakula is
simply called Lord of the Earth. He was a powerful prince but he could
hardly claim to be ruler of &ldquo;the whole circumference of the
earth.&rdquo; He therefore cannot be the installer of
Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha. Taking next the Guptas of Magadha we find on
the Bhit√°ri seal the title of
Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja given to each of them, but
there is considerable reason to believe that their power had long since
shrunk to Magadha and Eastern M√°lwa, and if Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s
B√°l√°ditya is Narasim&#803;hagupta, he must have been
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;520 a feudatory of Mihirakula,
and could not be spoken of as supreme lord, nor as ruler of the whole
earth. The Guptas of M√°lwa have even less claim to these titles,
as Bh√°nugupta was a mere Mah√°r√°ja, and all that is
known of him is that he won a battle at Era&#7751; in Eastern
M√°lwa in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;510&ndash;11. Last of
all comes <span class="corr" id="xd25e11535" title="Source: Vishnuvardhana">Vish&#7751;uvardhana</span> or
Ya&#347;odharman of Mandasor. In one of the Mandasor inscriptions he
has the titles of R√°j√°dhir√°ja and Parame&#347;vara
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;532&ndash;33); in another he boasts
of having carried his conquests from the Lauhitya (Brahmaputra) to the
western ocean and from the Him√°laya to mount Mahendra. It seems
obvious that Ya&#347;odharman is the Paramasv√°mi of the Valabhi
plate, and that the reference to the western ocean relates to
Bha&#7789;√°rka&rsquo;s successes against the
Maitrakas.&mdash;(A.M.T.J.)&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n88.3src">&uarr;</a></p>

the Parthians (<abbr title="Annals of R√°jasth√°n">An. of

Elliot (History, I. 408) accepting Tod&rsquo;s date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;524 refers the overthrow to Skythian barbarians
from Sindh. Elphinstone, also accepting <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;524 as an approximate date, suggested (History,

Chosroes the Great (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;531&ndash;579)
citing in support of a Sassanian inroad Malcolm&rsquo;s Persia, I. 141
and Pottinger&rsquo;s Travels, 386. Forbes (R√°s
M√°l√°, I. 22) notes that the Jain accounts give the date
of the overthrow Vik. Sam&#803;. 375 that is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319 apparently in confusion with the epoch of the
Gupta era which the Valabhi kings adopted.<a class="noteref" id="n94.asrc" href="#n94.a" name="n94.asrc">39</a> Forbes says (Ditto,
24): If the destroyers had not been called <i>mlechchhas</i> I might

Thomas (Prinsep&rsquo;s Useful Tables, 158) fixes the destruction of
Valabhi at <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;745 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 802). In the K√°thi√°w√°r
Gazetteer Col. Watson in one passage (page 671) says the destroyers may
have been the early Muhammadans who retired as quickly as they came. In
another passage (page 274), accepting Mr. Burgess&rsquo; (<abbr title="Arch&aelig;ological Survey Report">Arch. Sur. Rep.</abbr> IV. 75)
Gupta era of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;195 and an overthrow
date of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;642, and citing a
Wadhw√°n couplet telling how Ebhal Valabhi withstood the
Iranians, Col. Watson suggests the destroyers may have been Iranians.
If the P√°rsis came in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;642 they
must have come not as raiders but as refugees. If they could they would
not have destroyed Valabhi. If the P√°rsis destroyed Valabhi

authorities (<abbr title="Annals of R√°jasth√°n">An. of
R√°j.</abbr> I. 82 and 217&ndash;220) represents <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;524 the practical establishment of the Valabhi
dynasty. The mistake of ascribing an era to the overthrow not to the
founding of a state occurs (compare Sachau&rsquo;s Alberuni, II. 6) in
the case both of the Vikrama era <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;57
and of the &#346;√°liv√°hana era <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78. In both these cases the error was
intentional. It was devised with the aim of hiding the supremacy of
foreigners in early Hindu history. So also, according to
Alberuni&rsquo;s information (Sachau, II. 7) the Guptak√°la
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319 marks the ceasing not the
beginning of the wicked and powerful Guptas. This device is not
confined to India. His Mede informant told Herodotus (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;450 Rawlinson&rsquo;s Herodotus, I. 407) that
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;708 was the founding of the Median
monarchy. The date really marked the overthrow of the Medes by the
Assyrian Sargon.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n94.asrc">&uarr;</a></p>

notices what is perhaps a reminiscence of this date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;766). It is the story that Bappa, who according
to Mew√°&#7693; tradition is the founder of Gehlot power at
Chitor, abandoned his country for Ir√°n in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;764 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 820).
It seems probable that this Bappa or Saila is not the founder of Gehlot
power at Chitor, but, according to the Valabhi use of Bappa, is the
founder&rsquo;s father and that this retreat to Ir√°n refers to
his being carried captive to Mans&uacute;ra on the fall either of
Valabhi or of Gandh√°r.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n94.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

(compare R√°s M√°l√°, I. 18) is probably at the root
of the antique tale of Lot and the Cities of the Plain, that men whose
city was so completely destroyed must have been sinners beyond others.
Dr. Nicholson (<abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R.

Valabhi bore many traces of destruction by water.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n94.3src">&uarr;</a></p>

href="#n95.1src" name="n95.1">42</a></span> Lassen (Ind. Alt. III. 533)
puts aside Alberuni&rsquo;s Arab expedition from Mans&uacute;ra as
without historical support and inadmissible. Lassen held that Valabhi
flourished long after its alleged destruction from Mans&uacute;ra.
Lassen&rsquo;s statement (see Ind. Alt. III. 533) is based on the
mistaken idea that as the Valabhis were the Balharas the
Balharas&rsquo; capital M√°nkir must be Valabhi. So far as is
known, except Alberuni himself (see below) none of the Arab geographers
of the ninth<span class="corr" id="xd25e12607" title="Not in source">,</span> tenth or eleventh centuries mentions Valabhi.
It is true that according to Lassen (Ind. Alt. 536) Masudi <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;915, Istakhri <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;951, and Ibn H√°ukal <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;976 all attest the existence of Valabhi up to
their own time. This remark is due either to the mistake regarding
Malkhet or to the identification of B√°lwi or Balzi in Sindh
(Elliot&rsquo;s History, I. 27&ndash;34) with Valabhi. The only known
Musalm√°n reference to Valabhi later than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750 is Alberuni&rsquo;s statement (Sachau, II. 7)
that the Valabhi of the era is 30 <i>yojanas</i> or 200 miles south of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e12626" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>.
That after its overthrow Valabhi remained, as it still continues, a
local town has been shown in the text. Such an after-life is in no way
inconsistent with its destruction as a leading capital in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;767.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n95.1src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n95.2"

(Sachau, I. 21) Al Mans&uacute;ra, which was close to
Br√°hman√°b√°d about 47 miles north-east of
Haidar√°b√°d (Elliot&rsquo;s Musalm√°n Historians, I.
372&ndash;374) was built by the great Muhammad K√°sim about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;713. Apparently Alberuni wrote
Muhammad K√°sim by mistake for his grandson Amru Muhammad
(Elliot, I. 372 note 1 and 442&ndash;3), who built the city a little
before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750. Reinaud (Fragments, 210)
makes Amru the son of Muhammad K√°sim. Masudi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;915) gives the same date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750), but (Elliot, I. 24) makes the builder the
Ummayide governor Mans&uacute;r bin Jamhur. Idr&iacute;si (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1137 Elliot, I. 78) says Mans&uacute;ra was built
and named in honour of the Khalif Abu J√°far-al-Mansur. If so its
building would be later than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;754. On
such a point Idr&iacute;si&rsquo;s authority carries little

the different proposed readings (Elliot, I. 444 note 1) N√°rand,
Barand, and Barid. So far as the original goes Balaba is probably as
likely a rendering as Barada. Reinaud (Fragments, 212) says he cannot
restore the name.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n95.4src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n95.5"

to the Porbandar range of hills, the name Barada is almost unknown, and
though Ghumli not Barada was the early (eighth-twelfth century) capital
of Porbandar some place named Barada seems to have existed on the
Porbandar coast. As early as the second century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, Ptolemy (McCrindle, 37) has a town Barda-xema on the
coast west of the village <i>Kome</i> (probably the road or <i>kom</i>)
of <span class="corr" id="xd25e12695" title="Source: Saur√°shtra">Saur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>; and St.

people of Kachh with the Varadas according to Hemachandra (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1150) a class of foreigners or <i>mlechchhas</i>.
A somewhat tempting identification of Barada is with Beruni&rsquo;s
B√°rwi (Sachau, I. 208) or Baraoua (Reinaud&rsquo;s Fragments,
121) 84 miles (14 <i>parasangs</i>) west of Soman√°tha. But an
examination of Beruni&rsquo;s text shows that B√°rwi is not the
name of a place but of a product of Kachh the <i>b√°ra</i> or

<p class="footnote cont">Even after <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;770 Valabhi seems to have been attacked by the
Arabs. Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l notices that two Jain dates for the
destruction of the city 826 and 886 are in the Vira era and that this
means not the Mah√°vira era of <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;526 but the Vikram era of <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;57. The corresponding dates are therefore
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;769 and 829. Evidence in support of
the <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;769 and 770 defeat is given in
the text. On behalf of Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s second date
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;829 it is remarkable that in or about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;830 (Elliot, I. 447) M&uacute;sa the
Arab governor of Sindh captured B√°la the ruler of As Sharqi. As
there seems no reason to identify this As Sharqi with the Sindh lake of
As Sharqi mentioned in a raid in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750
(Elliot, I. 441: <abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J.
R. A. S.</abbr> (1893) page 76) the phrase would mean B√°la king
of the east. The Arab record of the defeat of B√°la would thus be
in close agreement with the Jain date for the latest foreign attack on

inaccuracy of Idr&iacute;si (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1137) in
placing the Balharas capital in Gujar√°t (Elliot, I. 87)
suggested a connection between Balhara and Valabhi. The suitableness of
this identification was increased by the use among R√°jput
writers of the title Balakarai for the Valabhi chief (Tod <abbr title="Annals of R√°jasth√°n">An. of R√°j.</abbr> I. 83)

R√°na of Udepur, while enjoying the title of Sun of the Hindus,
prospering under the sun banner, and specially worshipping the sun
(Tod&rsquo;s Annals, I. 565) is at the same time the Minister of
&#346;iva the One Lin&#775;g <i>Eklingakadiw√°n</i> (Ditto 222,
R√°j. Gaz. III. 53). The blend is natural. The fierce noon-tide
sun is Mah√°k√°la the Destroyer. Like &#346;iva the Sun is
lord of the Moon. And marshalled by Soman√°tha the great Soul
Home the souls of the dead pass heavenwards along the rays of the
setting sun. [Compare Sachau&rsquo;s Alberuni, II. 168.] It is the
common sun element in &#346;aivism and in Vaishnavism that gives their
holiness to the sunset shrines of Soman√°tha and Dw√°rka.
For (Ditto, 169) the setting sun is the door whence men march forth
into the world of existence Westwards, heavenwards.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n98.3src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n98.4"
href="#n98.4src" name="n98.4">59</a></span> This explanation is hardly
satisfactory. The name Gehlot seems to be Guhila-putra from
Gobhila-putra an ancient Br√°hman gotra, one of the not uncommon
cases of R√°jputs with a Br√°hman gotra. The R√°jput
use of a Br√°hman gotra is generally considered a technical
affiliation, a mark of respect for some Br√°hman teacher. It
seems doubtful whether the practice is not a reminiscence of an
ancestral Br√°hman strain. This view finds confirmation in the
Aitpur inscription (Tod&rsquo;s Annals, I. 802) which states that
Guhadit the founder of the Gohil tribe was of Br√°hman race

href="#n99.9src" name="n99.9">71</a></span> The V√°la connection
with the K√°this complicates their history. Col. Watson
(K√°th. Gaz. 130) seems to favour the view that the V√°las
were the earliest wave of K√°this who came into
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a from M√°lwa apparently with
the Guptas (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450) (Ditto, 671). Col.
Watson seems to have been led to this conclusion in consequence of the
existence of the petty state of K√°tti in west Kh√°ndesh.
But the people of the K√°tti state in west Kh√°ndesh are
Bhils or Kolis. Neither the people nor the position of the country
seems to show connection with the K√°this of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Col. Watson (K√°th. Gaz.
130) inclines to hold that the V√°las are an example of the
rising of a lower class to be R√°jputs. That both V√°las
and K√°this are northerners admitted into Hinduism may be
accepted. Still it seems probable that on arrival in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a the V√°las were the leaders
of the K√°this and that it is mainly since the fall of Valabhi
that a large branch of the V√°las have sunk to be K√°this.
The K√°thi traditions admit the superiority of the V√°las.
According to Tod (Western India, 270: Annals, I. 112&ndash;113) the
K√°this claim to be a branch or descendants of the V√°las.
In K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a the V√°las, the highest
division of K√°this (R√°s M√°l√°, I. 296;
K√°th. Gaz. 122, 123, 131, 139), admit that their founder was a
V√°la R√°jput who lost caste by marrying a K√°thi
woman. Another tradition (R√°s M√°l√°, I. 296;
K√°th. Gaz. 122 note 1) records that the K√°this flying
from Sindh took refuge with the V√°las and became their
followers. Col. Watson (K√°th. Gaz. 130) considers the practice
in Porbandar and <span class="corr" id="xd25e13195" title="Source: Navanagar">Nav√°nagar</span> of styling any lady of the
Dh√°nk V√°la family who marries into their house
K√°thi√°n&iacute;b√°i the K√°thi lady proves
that the V√°las are K√°this. But as this name must be used
with respect it may be a trace that the V√°las claim to be lords
of the K√°this as the Jetwas claim to be lords of the Mers. That
the position of the V√°las and K√°this as R√°jputs is
doubtful in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and is assured
(Tod&rsquo;s Annals, I. 111) in R√°jput√°na is strange. The
explanation may perhaps be that aloofness from Muhammadans is the
practical test of honour among <span class="corr" id="xd25e13198"
title="Source: R√°jputana">R√°jput√°na</span> Hindus,
and that in the troubled times between the thirteenth and the
seventeenth centuries, like the Jh√°l√°s, the V√°las
and K√°this may have refused Moghal alliances, and so won the
approval of the R√°n√°s of

For the alleged descent of the Sesodi√°s and V√°las from
R√°ma of the Sun race the explanation may be offered that the
greatness of Kanishka, whose power was spread from the Ganges to the
Oxus, in accordance with the Hindu doctrine (compare Beal&rsquo;s
Buddhist Records, I. 99 &amp; 152; R√°s M√°l√°, I.
320; Fryer&rsquo;s New Account, 190) that a conqueror&rsquo;s success
is the fruit of transcendent merit in a former birth, led to Kanishka
being considered an incarnation of R√°ma. A connection between
Kanishka and the race of the Sun would be made easy by the intentional
confusing of the names Kshatrapa and Kshatriya and by the fact that
during part at least of his life fire and the sun were Kanishka&rsquo;s

href="#n103.4src" name="n103.4">94</a></span> St. Martin <span lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque et Latine de l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 403,
puts the probable date at <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;380 or
about fifty years before Alexander. St. Martin held that the passage
belonged to the final revision of the poem. Since St. Martin&rsquo;s
time the tendency has been to lower the date of the final revision by
at least 500 years. The fact noted by St. Martin (Ditto, page 404) that
Jartika which the Mah√°bh√°rata writer gives as another
name for B√°hika is a Sanskritised form of Jat further supports
the later date. It is now generally accepted that the Jats are one of
the leading tribes who about the beginning of the Christian era passed
from Central Asia into India.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n103.4src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n103.5"
href="#n103.5src" name="n103.5">95</a></span> The name Valabhi, as we
learn from the Jain historians, is a Sanskritised form of Valahi, which
can be easily traced back to one of the many forms
(B√°lh&iacute;ka, B√°lhika, Balhika, Bahl&iacute;ka,
B√°hlika, V√°hl&iacute;ka, Vahl&iacute;ka,
V√°lh&iacute;ka, V√°lhika, Valhika) of a tribal name which
is of common occurrence in the Epics. This name is, no doubt rightly,
traced back to the city of Balkh, and originally denoted merely the
people of Baktria. There is, however, evidence that the name also
denoted a tribe doubtless of Baktrian origin, but settled in India: the
Emperor Chandra speaks of defeating the V√°hlikas after crossing
the seven mouths of the Indus: Var√°ha-Mihira speaks of the
V√°lhikas along with the people who dwell on Sindhu&rsquo;s banks
(B&#7771;. Sam&#803;. V. 80): and, most decisive of all, the
K√°&#347;ik√° V&#7771;itti on P√°&#7751;. VIII. iv. 9
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;650) gives Bahl&iacute;ka as the
name of the people of the Sauv&iacute;ra country, which, as Alberuni
tells us, corresponded to the modern Mult√°n, the very country to
which the traditions of the modern V√°las point.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">If the usual derivation of the name
B√°lhika be accepted,<a class="noteref" id="n103.5.asrc" href="#n103.5.a" name="n103.5.asrc">96</a> it is possible to go a step
further and fix a probable limit before which the tribe did not enter
India. The name of Balkh in the sixth century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> was, as we learn from Darius&rsquo; inscriptions,
B√°khtri, and the Greeks also knew it as Baktra: the Avesta form
is Bakhdhi, which according to the laws of sound-change established by
Prof. Darmsteter for the Arachosian language as represented by the
modern Pushtu, would become Bahli (see <span lang="fr">Chants
Populaires des Afghans</span>, Introd. page xxvii). This reduction of
the hard aspirates to spirants seems to have taken place about the
first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>: parallel cases are the
change from Parthava to Palhava, and Mithra to Mihira. It would seem
therefore that the Bahlikas did not enter India before the first
century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>: and if we may identify their
subduer Chandra with Chandragupta I., we should have the fourth century
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> as a lower limit for dating their
invasion.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Unfortunately, however, these limits cannot at
present be regarded as more than plausible: for the name Balhika or
Valhika appears to occur in works that can hardly be as modern as the
first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> The
Atharvaveda-pari&#347;ishtas might be put aside, as they show strong
traces of Greek influence and are therefore of late date: and the
supposed occurrences in P√°&#7751;ini belong to the commentators
and to the Ga&#7751;ap√°&#7789;ha only and are of more or less
uncertain age. But the name occurs, in the form Balhika, in one hymn of
the Atharvaveda itself (Book V. 22) which there is no reason to suppose
is of late date.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The lower limit is also uncertain as the
identification of Chandra of the inscription with the Gupta king is
purely conjectural.&mdash;(A. M. T. J.)&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n103.5src">&uarr;</a></p>

Report of 1881) the national name Baluch has become a tribal name in

Chapter IX.<br>
<span class="sc">The Ch√°lukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634&ndash;740.</span></span> The Ch√°lukyas
conquered their Gujar√°t provinces from the south after subduing
the Konkan Mauryas of Pur&iacute; either R√°j√°pur&iacute;
that is Janjira or Elephanta in Bombay harbour. The fifth century
V√°da inscription of king Suketuvarmman proves that this Maurya
dynasty<a class="noteref" id="n107.1src" href="#n107.1" name="n107.1src">1</a> ruled in the Konkan for at least a century before
they came into collision with the Ch√°lukyas under
K&iacute;rtivarmman.<a class="noteref" id="n107.2src" href="#n107.2"
name="n107.2src">2</a> They were finally defeated and their capital
Pur&iacute; taken by Cha&#7751;&#7693;ada&#7751;&#7693;a an officer of
Pulake&#347;i II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;640).<a class="noteref" id="n107.3src"
href="#n107.3" name="n107.3src">3</a> The Ch√°lukyas then pressed
northwards, and an inscription at Aihole in South Bij√°pur
records that as early as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634 the
kings of L√°&#7789;a, M√°lava, and Gurjjara submitted to
the prowess of Pulake&#347;i II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;640).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jayasim&#803;havarmman, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;666&ndash;693.</span>The regular establishment of
Ch√°lukya power in South Gujar√°t seems to have been the
work of Dh√°r√°&#347;raya Jayasim&#803;havarmman son of
Pulake&#347;i II. and younger brother of Vikram√°ditya
Saty√°&#347;raya (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;670&ndash;680). A grant of
Jayasim&#803;havarmman&rsquo;s son &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya found
in Navs√°r&iacute; describes Jayasim&#803;havarmman as receiving
the kingdom from his brother Vikram√°ditya. As
Jayasim&#803;havarmman is called
<i>Paramabha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka</i> Great Lord, he probably was
practically independent. He had five sons and enjoyed a long life,
ruling apparently from Navs√°r&iacute;. Of the five
Gujar√°t Ch√°lukya copperplates noted below, three are in
an era marked Sam&#803;. which is clearly different from the &#346;aka
era (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78) used in the grants of the
main Ch√°lukyas. From the nature of the case the new era of the
Gujar√°t Ch√°lukyas may be accepted as of Gujar√°t
origin. Grants remain of Jayasim&#803;havarmman&rsquo;s sons dated
&#346;. 421, 443, and 490.<a class="noteref" id="n107.4src" href="#n107.4" name="n107.4src">4</a> This checked by
Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s known date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;670&ndash;680) gives an initial between
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;249 and 259. Of the two
Gujar√°t eras, the Gupta-Valabhi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;319) and the Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248&ndash;9), the Gupta-Valabhi is
clearly unsuitable. On the other hand the result is so closely in
accord with <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;248&ndash;9, the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka epoch, as to place the correctness of the
identification almost beyond question.</p>
<p>Jayasim&#803;havarmman must have established his power in South
Gujar√°t before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669&ndash;70
(T. 421), as in that year his son &#346;ry√°&#347;raya made a
grant as heir apparent. Another plate of &#346;ry√°&#347;raya
found in Surat shows that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691&ndash;2 (T. 443) Jayasim&#803;havarmman was
still ruling with &#346;ry√°&#347;raya as heir apparent. In view
of these facts the establishment of Jayasim&#803;havarmman&rsquo;s
power in Gujar√°t must be taken at about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;666. The copperplates of his sons and grandson do
not say whom Jayasim&#803;havarmman overthrew. Probably the defeated
rulers were Gurjjaras, as about this time a Gurjjara dynasty held the
Broach district with its capital at N√°nd&iacute;pur&iacute; the
modern N√°ndod in the R√°jpipla State about thirty-five
miles east of Broach. So far <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<span class="sc">The Ch√°lukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634&ndash;740.</span><br>
Jayasim&#803;havarmman <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;666&ndash;693.</span> as is known the earliest of
the N√°ndod Gurjjaras was Dadda who is estimated to have
flourished about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580 (T.
331).<a class="noteref" id="n108.1src" href="#n108.1" name="n108.1src">5</a> The latest is Jayabha&#7789;a whose
Navs√°r&iacute; copperplate bears date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;734&ndash;5 (T. 486)<a class="noteref" id="n108.2src" href="#n108.2" name="n108.2src">6</a> so that the Gurjjara
and Ch√°lukya kingdoms flourished almost at the same time. It is
possible that the power of the earlier Gurjjara kings spread as far
south as Bals√°r and even up to Konkan limits. It was apparently
from them that, during the reign of his brother Vikram√°ditya,
Jayasim&#803;havarmman took South Gujar√°t, driving the Gurjjaras
north of the T√°pti and eventually confining them to the Broach
district, the Gurjjaras either acknowledging Ch√°lukya
sovereignty or withstanding the Ch√°lukyas and retaining their
small territory in the Broach district by the help of the Valabhis with
whom they were in alliance.<a class="noteref" id="n108.3src" href="#n108.3" name="n108.3src">7</a> In either case the Ch√°lukya
power seems to have hemmed in the Broach Gurjjaras, as
Jayasim&#803;havarmman had a son Buddhavarmman ruling in Kaira. A
copperplate of Buddhavarmman&rsquo;s son Vijayar√°ja found in
Kaira is granted from Vijayapura identified with Bij√°pur near
<span class="corr" id="xd25e13891" title="Source: P√°rantij">Par√°ntij</span>, but probably some
place further south, as the grant is made to Br√°hmans of
Jambusar. Five copperplates remain of this branch of the
Ch√°lukyas, the Navs√°r&iacute; grant of
&#346;ry√°&#347;raya &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya Yuvar√°ja
dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669&ndash;70 (T. 421); the
Surat grant of the same &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691&ndash;2 (T. 443); the Bals√°r grant of
Vinay√°ditya Mangalar√°ja dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;731 (&#346;aka 653); the Navs√°r&iacute;
grant of Pulake&#347;i Jan√°&#347;raya dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738&ndash;9 (T. 490); the Kaira grant of
Vijayar√°ja dated &#346;am&#803;vatsara 394; and the undated
Nirpan grant of N√°gavarddhana Tribhuvan√°&#347;raya.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&#346;ry√°&#347;raya
&#346;&iacute;l√°ditya (Heir Apparent), <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669&ndash;691.</span>The first four grants
mention Jayasim&#803;havarmman as the younger brother of
Vikram√°ditya Saty√°&#347;raya the son of Pulake&#347;i
Saty√°&#347;raya the conqueror of Harshavarddhana the lord of the
North. Jayasim&#803;havarmman&rsquo;s eldest son was
&#346;ry√°&#347;raya &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya who made his
Navs√°r&iacute; grant in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669&ndash;70 (T. 421); the village granted being
said to be in the Navas√°rik√° Vishaya.
&#346;ry√°&#347;raya&rsquo;s other plate dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691&ndash;2 (T. 443) grants a field in the
village of Osumbhal√° in the K√°rmaneya &Aacute;h√°ra
that is the district of K√°mlej on the T√°pti fifteen miles
north-east of Surat. In both grants &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya is
called Yuvar√°ja, which shows that his father ruled with him from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691. Both copperplates show that these kings
treated as their overlords the main dynasty of the southern
Ch√°lukyas as respectful mention is made in the first plate of
Vikram√°ditya Saty√°&#347;raya and in the second of his son
Vinay√°ditya Saty√°&#347;raya. Apparently
&#346;ry√°&#347;raya died before his father as the two late
grants of Bals√°r and Khe&#7693;√° give him no place in the
list of rulers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mangalar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;698&ndash;731.</span>Jayasim&#803;havarmman was
succeeded by his second son Mangalar√°ja. A plate of his found at
Bals√°r dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;731 (&#346;aka
653) records a grant made from Mangalapur&iacute;, probably the same as
Pur&iacute; the doubtful Konkan capital of the
&#346;il√°h√°ras.<a class="noteref" id="n108.4src" href="#n108.4" name="n108.4src">8</a> As his elder brother was heir-apparent
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691&ndash;2 (T. 443),
Mangalar√°ja must have succeeded some years later, say about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;698&ndash;9 (T. 450). From this it
may be inferred that the copperplate of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;731 was issued towards the end of his reign.

Pulake&#347;i Jan√°&#347;raya, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738.</span> Pulake&#347;i was at this time ruling
at Navs√°r&iacute;. It is uncertain how much longer this
Ch√°lukya kingdom of Navs√°r&iacute; continued. It was
probably overthrown about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750 by the
Gujar√°t branch of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as who
were in possession in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;757&ndash;8.<a class="noteref" id="n110.1src"

<p><span class="marginnote">Buddhavarmman, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;713 (?).</span>The Kaira grant dated 394 gives in

Vijayar√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n110.2src" href="#n110.2"
name="n110.2src">12</a> The grant is made from Vijayapura, which, as
the late Colonel West suggested, may be Bij√°pur near
Par√°ntij though this is far to the north of the otherwise known
Ch√°lukya limits. The village granted is Pariyaya in the
K√°&#347;√°kula division. If taken as
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka the date 394 corresponds to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;642&ndash;3. This is out of the question, since
Vijayar√°ja&rsquo;s grand-uncle Vikram√°ditya flourished
between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;670 and 680. Professor
Bhandarkar considers the plate a forgery, but there seems no sufficient
reason for doubting its genuineness. No fault can be found with the
character. It is written in the usual style of Western Ch√°lukya
grants, and contains the names of a number of Br√°hman grantees
with minute details of the fields granted a feature most unusual in a
forged grant. In the Gupta era, which equally with the
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era may be denoted by the word <i><abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">Sam&#803;.</abbr></i> and which is more likely to be in
use in North Gujar√°t the 394 would represent the fairly probable
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;713. Jayasim&#803;ha may have
conquered part of North Gujar√°t and sent his son Buddhavarmman
to rule over it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">N√°gavarddhana.</span>Jayasim&#803;ha
appears to have had a third son N√°gavarddhana ruling in West
N√°sik which was connected with South Gujar√°t through
Bals√°r, P√°rdi, and Penth. The Nirpan grant of
N√°gavarddhana is undated,<a class="noteref" id="n110.3src" href="#n110.3" name="n110.3src">13</a> and, though it gives a wrong
genealogy, its seal, the form of composition, the <i>biruda</i> or
title of the king, and the alphabet all so closely agree with the style
of the Gujar√°t Ch√°lukya plates that it cannot be
considered a forgery.</p>
<p>Not long after <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;740 the
Ch√°lukyas seem to have been supplanted in South Gujar√°t
by the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as.</p>

Chapter IX.<br>
<span class="sc">The Ch√°lukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634&ndash;740.</span></span>
Vijayar√°ja&rsquo;s grant of the year 394 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;642&ndash;3) is the earliest trace of
Ch√°lukya rule in Gujar√°t. Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l,
who believed in its genuineness, supposes it to be dated in the Gupta
era (<span class="sc">G.</span> 394 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;714) and infers from it the existence of
Ch√°lukya rule far to the north of Broach. But the most cursory
comparison of it with the Khe&#7693;√° grants of Dadda II. (see
<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 81ff) which are
dated (admittedly in the [so-called] Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era) 380
and 385 respectively, shows that a large number of Dadda&rsquo;s
grantees reappear in the Ch√°lukya grant. The date of the
Ch√°lukya plate must therefore be interpreted as a
Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka or Chedi date.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;640.</span>This being so, it is clearly
impossible to suppose that Vijayar√°ja&rsquo;s grandfather
Jayasim&#803;ha is that younger son of Pulake&#347;i II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;640) who founded the Gujar√°t
branch family. It has been usually supposed that the Jayasim&#803;ha of
our grant was a younger brother of Pulake&#347;i II.: but this also is
chronologically impossible: for Jayasim&#803;ha can hardly have been
more than ten years of age in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;597&ndash;98, when his elder brother was set
aside as too young to rule. His son Buddhavarmman could hardly have
been born before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610, so that
Buddhavarmman&rsquo;s son Vijayar√°ja must have made his grant at
the age of twelve at latest. The true solution of the question seems to
be that given by Dr. Bhand√°rkar in his Early History of the
Deccan (page 42 note 7), namely that the grant is a forgery. To the
reasons advanced by him may be added the fact pointed out by Mr. Fleet
(<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> VII. 251) that the
grant is a palimpsest, the engraver having originally commenced it
&ldquo;Svasti Vijayavikshep√°n Na.&rdquo; It can hardly be
doubted that <i>Na</i> is the first syllable of
N√°nd&iacute;pur&iacute; the palace of the Gurjjara kings. Many
of the grantees were Br√°hmans of Jambusar and subjects of Dadda
II. of Broach, whose grants to them are extant. It seems obvious that
Vijayar√°ja&rsquo;s grant was forged in the interest of these
persons by some one who had Gurjjara grants before him as models, but
knew very little of the forms used in the chancery of the
Ch√°lukyas.</p>
<p>Setting aside this grant, the first genuine trace of Ch√°lukya
rule in Gujar√°t is to be found in the grant of the Sendraka
chief Nikumbhalla&#347;akti, which bears date Sam&#803;. 406
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;654&ndash;5) and relates to the gift
to a Br√°hman of the village of Balisa (Wanesa) in the
Treya&#7751;&#7751;a (Ten) district. Dr. B&uuml;hler has shown
(<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVIII. page 265ff)
that the Sendrakas were a K√°narese family, and that
Nikumbhalla&#347;akti must have come to Gujar√°t as a
Ch√°lukya feudatory, though he names no overlord. He was
doubtless subordinate to the Ch√°lukya governor of
N√°sik.</p>
<p>The next grant that requires notice is that of N√°gavarddhana,
who describes himself distinctly as the son of Pulake&#347;i&rsquo;s
brother Jayasim&#803;ha, though Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l believed
this Jayasim&#803;ha to be Pulake&#347;i&rsquo;s son. Mr. Fleet points
out other difficulties connected with this grant, but on the whole
decides in favour of its genuineness (see <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> IX. 123). The description of
Pulake&#347;i II. in this grant refers to his victory over
Harshavarddhana, but also describes him as having conquered the three
kingdoms of Chera, Chola, and P√°&#7751;&#7693;ya by means of his
horse of the Chitraka&#7751;&#7789;ha breed, and as meditating on the
feet of &#346;ri N√°gavarddhana. Now all of these epithets,
except the reference to Harshavarddhana, belong properly, not to
Pulake&#347;i II. but to his son Vikram√°ditya I. The conquest of
the confederacy of Cholas, Cheras (or Keral&#803;as), and
P√°&#7751;&#7693;yas is ascribed to Vikram√°ditya in the
inscriptions of his son Vinay√°ditya (Fleet in <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> X. 134): the
Chitraka&#7751;&#7789;ha horse is named in Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s
own grants (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 75
&amp;c.) while his meditation upon the feet of N√°gavarddhana
recurs in the T. 421 grant of &#346;ry√°&#347;raya
&#346;&iacute;l√°ditya (<abbr title="Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society">B. B. R. A. S.</abbr> XVI. 1ff).
This confusion of epithets between Pulake&#347;i II. and
Vikram√°ditya makes it difficult to doubt that
N√°gavarddhana&rsquo;s grant was composed either during or after
Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s reign, and under the influence of that
king&rsquo;s grants. It may be argued that even in that case the grant
may be genuine, its inconsistencies being due merely to carelessness.
This supposition the following considerations seem <span class="corr"
id="xd25e14435" title="Source: to">too</span> negative. Pulake&#347;i
II. was alive at the time of Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s visit (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640), but is not likely to have reigned very much
longer. And, as Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s reign is supposed to have
begun about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;669&ndash;70, a gap
remains of nearly thirty years. That part of this period was occupied
by the war with the three kings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter IX.<br>
<span class="sc">The Ch√°lukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634&ndash;740.</span></span> of the south we know
from Vikram√°ditya&rsquo;s own grants: but the grant of
&#346;ry√°&#347;raya &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya referred to
above seems to show that Vikram√°ditya was the successor, not of
his father, but of N√°gavarddhana upon whose feet he is described
as meditating. It follows that N√°gavarddhana succeeded
Pulake&#347;i and preceded Vikram√°ditya on the imperial throne
of the Ch√°lukyas whereas his grant could not have been composed
until the reign of Vikram√°ditya.</p>
<p>Although the grant is not genuine, we have no reason to doubt that
it gives a correct genealogy, and that N√°gavarddhana was the son
of Pulake&#347;i&rsquo;s brother Jayasim&#803;ha and therefore the
first cousin of Vikram√°ditya. The grant is in the regular
Ch√°lukya style, and the writer, living near the Northern
Ch√°lukya capital, N√°sik, had better models than the
composer of Vijayar√°ja&rsquo;s grant. Both grants may have been
composed about the time when the Ch√°lukya power succumbed to the
attacks of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743).&mdash;(A. M. T. J.)</p>

Chapter X.<br>
<span class="sc">The Gurjjaras, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580&ndash;808.</span></span> During Valabhi and
Ch√°lukya ascendancy a small Gurjjara kingdom flourished in and
about Broach. As has been noticed in the Valabhi chapter the Gurjjaras
were a foreign tribe who came to Gujar√°t from Northern India.
All the available information regarding the Broach Gurjjaras comes from
nine copperplates,<a class="noteref" id="n113.1src" href="#n113.1"
name="n113.1src">1</a> three of them forged, all obtained from South
Gujar√°t. These plates limit the regular Gurjjara territory to
the Broach district between the Mah&iacute; and the Narbad√°,
though at times their power extended north to Khe&#7693;√° and
south to the T√°pti. Like the grants of the contemporary
Gujar√°t Ch√°lukyas all the genuine copperplates are dated
in the Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era which begins in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;249&ndash;50.<a class="noteref" id="n113.2src"
href="#n113.2" name="n113.2src">2</a> The Gurjjara capital seems to
have been N√°nd&iacute;pur&iacute; or N√°ndor,<a class="noteref" id="n113.3src" href="#n113.3" name="n113.3src">3</a> the
modern N√°ndod the capital of R√°jpipla in Rewa
K√°ntha about thirty-four miles east of Broach. Two of their
grants issue <i>N√°nd&iacute;pur&iacute;tah&#803;</i><a class="noteref" id="n113.4src" href="#n113.4" name="n113.4src">4</a> that is
&lsquo;from N√°nd&iacute;pur&iacute;&rsquo; like the
<i>Valabh&iacute;tah&#803;</i> or &lsquo;from Valabhi&rsquo; of the
Valabhi copperplates, a phrase which in both cases seems to show the
place named was the capital since in other Gurjjara grants the word
<i>v√°saka</i> or camp occurs.<a class="noteref" id="n113.5src"
href="#n113.5" name="n113.5src">5</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Copperplates.</span>Though the Gurjjaras
held a considerable territory in South Gujar√°t their plates seem
to show they were not independent rulers. The general titles are either

&lsquo;He who has attained the five great titles,&rsquo; or
<i>S√°manta</i> Feudatory. In one instance Jayabha&#7789;a III.
who was probably a powerful ruler is called
<i>S√°mant√°dhipati</i><a class="noteref" id="n113.6src"
href="#n113.6" name="n113.6src">6</a> Lord of Feudatories. It is hard
to say to what suzerain these Broach Gurjjaras acknowledged fealty.
Latterly they seem to have accepted the Ch√°lukyas on the south
as their overlords. But during the greater part of their existence they
may have been feudatories of the Valabhi dynasty, who, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter X.<br>
<span class="sc">The Gurjjaras, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580&ndash;808.</span><br>
Copperplates.</span> mentioned above were probably Gurjjaras who passed
from M√°lwa to South Gujar√°t and thence by sea to Valabhi
leaving a branch in South Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>The facts that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;649 (Valabhi
330) a Valabhi king had a &lsquo;camp of victory&rsquo; at Broach where
Ra&#7751;agraha&rsquo;s plate<a class="noteref" id="n114.1src" href="#n114.1" name="n114.1src">7</a> shows the Gurjjaras were then ruling
and that the Gurjjara king Dadda II. gave shelter to a Valabhi king
establish a close connection between Valabhi and the N√°ndod
Gurjjaras.</p>
<p>Their copperplates and seals closely resemble the plates and seals
of the Gujar√°t Ch√°lukyas. The characters of all but the
forged grants are like those of Gujar√°t Ch√°lukya grants
and belong to the Gujar√°t variety of the Southern India style.
At the same time it is to be noted that the royal signature at the end
of the plates is of the northern type, proving that the Gurjjaras were
originally northerners. The language of most of the grants is Sanskrit
prose as in Valabhi plates in a style curiously like the style of the
contemporary author B√°&#7751;a in his great works the
K√°dambar&iacute; and Harshacharita. From this it may be inferred
that B√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s style was not peculiar to himself but
was the style in general use in India at that time.</p>

<p>A recently published grant<a class="noteref" id="n114.2src" href="#n114.2" name="n114.2src">8</a> made by Nirihullaka, the chieftain of
a jungle tribe in the lower valley of the Narbad√°, shows that
towards the end of the sixth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> that
region was occupied by wild tribes who acknowledged the supremacy of
the Chedi or Kalachuri kings: a fact which accounts for the use of the
Chedi or Traik&uacute;&#7789;aka era in South Gujar√°t.
Nirihullaka names with respect a king &#346;an&#775;kara&#7751;a, whom
Dr. B&uuml;hler would identify with &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a the
father of the Kalachuri Buddhavarmman who was defeated by
Mangal&iacute;&#347;a the Ch√°lukya about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600.<a class="noteref" id="n114.3src" href="#n114.3" name="n114.3src">9</a> &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a himself
must have flourished about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580, and
the Gurjjara conquest must be subsequent to this date. Another new
grant,<a class="noteref" id="n114.4src" href="#n114.4" name="n114.4src">10</a> which is only a fragment and contains no
king&rsquo;s name, but which on the ground of date (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">Sam&#803;.</abbr>&nbsp;346 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;594&ndash;5) and style may be safely attributed
to the Gurjjara dynasty, shows that the Gurjjaras were established in
the country within a few years of &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a&rsquo;s
probable date.</p>
<p>A still nearer approximation to the date of the Gurjjara conquest is
suggested by the change in the titles of Dharasena I. of Valabhi, who

adds the title of Mah√°s√°manta, which points to subjection
by some foreign power between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;571 and

this power was that of the Gurjjaras of Bh&iacute;nm√°l; and that

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>)<a class="noteref" id="n115.3src" href="#n115.3" name="n115.3src">13</a> to have &ldquo;uprooted the
N√°ga&rdquo; who must be the same as the jungle tribes ruled by
Nirihullaka and are now represented by the N√°ikd√°s of the
Panch Mah√°ls and the Talabdas or Locals of Broach. The northern
limit of Dadda&rsquo;s kingdom seems to have been the Vindhya, as the
grant of 380 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;628&ndash;29) says that
the lands lying around the feet of the Vindhya were for his pleasure.
At the same time it appears that part at least of Northern
Gujar√°t was ruled by the Mah√°s√°manta Dharasena of
Valabhi, who in Val. 270 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;589&ndash;90) granted a village in the

Harsha was defeated on the Narbad√° by Pulake&#347;i II. (which
took place before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634). The
protection given to the Valabhi king is perhaps referred to in the
Khe&#7693;√° grants in the mention of &ldquo;strangers and
suppliants and people in distress.&rdquo; If this is the case the
defeat of Valabhi took place before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;628&ndash;29, the date of the earlier of the
Khe&#7693;√° grants. On the other hand, the phrase quoted is by
no means decisive, and the fact that in Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s time
Dhruvasena of Valabhi was son-in-law of Harsha&rsquo;s son, makes it
unlikely that Harsha should have been at war with him. It follows that
the expedition referred to may have taken place in the reign of
Dharasena IV. who may have been the son of Dhruvasena by another wife
than Harsha&rsquo;s granddaughter.</p>
<p>To Dadda II.&rsquo;s reign belongs Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s notice of
the kingdom of Broach (<span class="sc">C.</span> 640 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>).<a class="noteref" id="n116.1src" href="#n116.1"
name="n116.1src">19</a> He says &ldquo;all their profit is from the
sea&rdquo; and describes the country as salt and barren, which is still
true of large tracts in the west and twelve hundred years ago was
probably the condition of a much larger area than at present. Hiuen
Tsiang does not say that Broach was subject to any other kingdom, but
it is clear from the fact that Dadda bore the five great titles that he
was a mere feudatory. At this period the valuable port of Broach, from
which all their profit was made, was a prize fought for by all the
neighbouring powers. With the surrounding country of L√°&#7789;a,
Broach submitted to Pulake&#347;i II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;640):<a class="noteref" id="n116.2src"
href="#n116.2" name="n116.2src">20</a> it may afterwards have fallen to
the M√°lava kings, to whom in Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s time
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;640) both Khe&#7693;√°
(K&rsquo;ie-ch&rsquo;a) and &Aacute;nandapura (Vadnagar) belonged;
later it was subject to Valabhi, as Dharasena IV. made a grant at
Broach in <abbr title="Vikram Sam&#803;vat">V.S.</abbr> 330

<p>Knowledge of the later Gurjjaras is derived exclusively from two
grants of Jayabha&#7789;a III. dated respectively 456 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;704&ndash;5) and 486 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;734&ndash;5).<a class="noteref" id="n116.4src"
href="#n116.4" name="n116.4src">22</a> The later of these two grants is
imperfect, only the last plate having been preserved. The earlier grant
of 456 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;704&ndash;5) shows that
during the half century following the reign of Dadda II. the dynasty
had ceased to call themselves Gurjjaras, and had adopted a <span class="corr" id="xd25e14950" title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> pedigree traced
from king Kar&#7751;a, a hero of the Bh√°rata war. It also shows
that from Dadda III. onward the family were &#346;aivas instead of
sun-worshippers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jayabha&#7789;a II. <span class="sc">C.</span> 650&ndash;675 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span>The

<span class="sc">C.</span> 675&ndash;700.</span>Jayabha&#7789;a&rsquo;s

studied Manu&rsquo;s works, and strictly enforced &ldquo;the duties of
the <i>var&#7751;as</i> or castes and of the <i>√°&#347;ramas</i>
or Br√°hman stages.&rdquo; It was probably to him that the
Gurjjaras owed their <span class="corr" id="xd25e14975" title="Source: Pur√°nic">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> pedigree and their
recognition as true Kshatriyas. Like his predecessors<span class="corr"

the five great titles, though no hint is given who was his suzerain.
His immediate superior may have been Jayasim&#803;ha the
Ch√°lukya, who received the province of L√°&#7789;a from
his brother Vikram√°ditya (c. 669&ndash;680 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>)<a class="noteref" id="n117.1src" href="#n117.1" name="n117.1src">23</a></p>

href="#n117.2" name="n117.2src">24</a> must belong respectively to the
beginning and the end of his reign. He attained the five great titles,
and was therefore a feudatory, probably of the Ch√°lukyas: but
his title of Mah√°s√°mant√°dhipati implies that he
was a chief of importance. He is praised in vague terms, but the only
historical event mentioned in his grants is a defeat of a lord of
Valabhi, noted in the grant of 486 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;734&ndash;5). The Valabhi king referred to must
be either &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya IV. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;691) or &#346;&iacute;l√°ditya V.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;722). During the reign of
Jayabha&#7789;a III. took place the great Arab invasion which was
repulsed by Pulake&#347;i Jan√°&#347;raya at
Navs√°r&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="n117.3src" href="#n117.3"
name="n117.3src">25</a> Like the kingdoms named in the grant of
Pulake&#347;i, Broach must have suffered from this raid. It is not
specially mentioned probably because it formed part of
Pulake&#347;i&rsquo;s territory.</p>
<p>After <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;734&ndash;5 no further
mention occurs of the Gurjjaras of Broach. Whether the dynasty was
destroyed by the Arabs or by the Gujar√°t
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750) is not known. Later references to Gurjjaras
in R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a times refer to the Gurjjaras
of Bh&iacute;nm√°l not to the Gurjjaras of Broach, who, about the
time of Dadda III. (<span class="sc">C.</span> 675&ndash;700
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>), ceased to call themselves Gurjjaras.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A few words must be said regarding the three grants
from Il√°o, Umet√°, and Bagumr√° (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 116, VII. 61, and XVII. 183)
as their genuineness has been assumed by Dr. B&uuml;hler in his recent
paper on the Mah√°bh√°rata, in spite of Mr. Fleet&rsquo;s
proof (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVIII. 19) that
their dates do not work out correctly.</p>
<p>Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 70) chief grounds for holding
that the Umet√° and Il√°o grants (the Bagumr√° grant
was unknown to him) were forgeries were:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Their close resemblance in pal&aelig;ography to one another and
to the forged grant of Dharasena II. of Valabhi dated &#346;aka
400;</li>
<li>(2) That though they purport to belong to the fifth century they
bear the same writer&rsquo;s name as the Khe&#7693;√° grants of
the seventh century.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further Mr. Fleet (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr>
XIII. 116) pointed out:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) That the description of Dadda I. in the Il√°o and
Umet√° grants agrees almost literally with that of Dadda II. in
the Khe&#7693;√° grants, and that where it differs the
Khe&#7693;√° grants have the better readings.</li>
</ul>
<p>To these arguments Dr. B&uuml;hler has replied (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVII. 183):</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) That though there is a resemblance between these grants and
that of Dharasena II., still it does not prove more than that the
forger of Dharasena&rsquo;s grant had one of the other grants before
him;</li>
<li>(2) That, as the father&rsquo;s name of the writer is not given in
the Khe&#7693;√° grants, it cannot be assumed that he was the
same person as the writer of the Il√°o and Umet√° grants;
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter X.<br>
<span class="sc">The Gurjjaras, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580&ndash;808.</span></span></li>
<li>(3) That genuine grants sometimes show that a description written
for one king is afterwards applied to another, and that good or bad
readings are no test of the age of a grant.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be admitted that Dr. B&uuml;hler has made it probable that
the suspected grants and the grant of Dharasena were not all written by
the same hand, and also that the coincidence in the writer&rsquo;s name
is not of much importance in itself. But the pal&aelig;ographical
resemblance between Dharasena&rsquo;s grant on the one hand and the
doubtful Gurjjara grants on the other is so close that they must have
been written at about the same time. As to the third point, the verbal
agreement between the doubtful grants on the one hand and the
Khe&#7693;√° grants on the other implies the existence of a
continuous tradition in the record office of the dynasty from the end
of the fifth till near the middle of the seventh century. But the
San&#775;khe&#7693;√° grant of Nirihullaka (<abbr title="Epigraphia Indica">Ep. Ind.</abbr> II. 21) shows that towards the end
of the sixth century the lower Narbad√° valley was occupied by
jungle tribes who acknowledged the supremacy of the Kalachuris. Is it
reasonable to suppose that after the first Gurjjara line was thus
displaced, the restorers of the dynasty should have had any memory of
the forms in which the first line drew up their grants? At any rate, if
they had, they would also have retained their original seal, which, as
the analogy of the Valabhi plates teaches us, would bear the
founder&rsquo;s name. But we find that the seal of the
Khe&#7693;√° plates bears the name &ldquo;S√°manta
Dadda,&rdquo; who can be no other than the &ldquo;S√°manta
Dadda&rdquo; who ruled from <span class="sc">C.</span> 585&ndash;605
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> It follows that the Gurjjaras of the
seventh century themselves traced back their history in Broach no
further than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;585. Again, it has been
pointed out in the text that a passage in the description of Dadda II.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;620&ndash;650) in the
Khe&#7693;√° grants seems to refer to his protection of the
Valabhi king, so that the description must have been written for
<i>him</i> and not for the fifth century Dadda as Dr.
B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s theory requires.</p>
<p>These points coupled with Mr. Fleet&rsquo;s proof (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVIII. 91) that the &#346;aka dates
do not work out correctly, may perhaps be enough to show that none of
these three grants can be relied upon as genuine.&mdash;(A. M. T.

<span class="sc">The R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743&ndash;974.</span></span> The
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a connection with Gujar√°t
lasted from &#346;aka 665 to 894 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743&ndash;974) that is for 231 years. The
connection includes three periods: A first of sixty-five years from
&#346;aka 665 to 730 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743&ndash;808)
when the Gujar√°t ruler was dependent on the main Dakhan
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a: a second of eighty years between
&#346;aka 730 and 810 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;808&ndash;888)
when the Gujar√°t family was on the whole independent: and a
third of eighty-six years &#346;aka 810 to 896 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;888&ndash;974) when the Dakhan
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as again exercised direct sway over
Gujar√°t.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Their Origin.</span>Information regarding
the origin of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as is imperfect.
That the Gujar√°t R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as came
from the Dakhan in &#346;aka 665 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743) is known. It is not known who the Dakhan
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as originally were or where or when
they rose to prominence. R√°tho&#7693; the dynastic name of
certain Kanauj and M√°rw√°r <span class="corr" id="xd25e15190" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> represents a
later form of the word R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a. Again
certain of the later inscriptions call the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as Ra&#7789;&#7789;as a word which,
so far as form goes, is hardly a correct Prakrit contraction of
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a. The Sanskritisation of tribal
names is not exact. If the name Ra&#7789;&#7789;a was strange it might
be pronounced Ratta, Ratha, or Raddi. This last form almost coincides
with the modern K√°narese caste name Reddi, which, so far as
information goes, would place the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as among the tribes of pre-Sanskrit
southern origin.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Their Name.</span>If Ra&#7789;&#7789;a is
the name of the dynasty <i>k&uacute;&#7789;a</i> or
<i>k&uacute;&#7693;a</i> may be an attribute meaning prominent. The
combination R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a would then mean the
chiefs or leaders as opposed to the rank and file of the
Ra&#7789;&#7789;as. The bardic accounts of the origin of the
R√°tho&#7693;s of Kanauj and <span class="corr" id="xd25e15203"
title="Source: Marw√°r">M√°rw√°r</span> vary greatly.
According to a Jain account the R√°tho&#7693;s, whose name is
fancifully derived from the <i>raht</i> or spine of Indra, are
connected with the Yavans through an ancestor Yavana&#347;va prince of
P√°rlipur. The R√°tho&#7693; genealogies trace their origin
to Ku&#347;a son of R√°ma of the Solar Race. The bards of the

Abhimanyu. This plate is not dated. Still its letters, its style of
writing, and its lion seal, older than the Garu&#7693;a mark which the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as assumed along with the claim of
Y√°dava descent, leave no doubt that this is the earliest of
known R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a plates. Its probable date
is about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450. The plate traces the
descent of Abhimanyu through two generations from
M√°n√°n&#775;ka. The details are:</p>

<p>The grant is dated from M√°napura, perhaps
M√°n√°n&#775;ka&rsquo;s city, probably an older form of
M√°nyakhe&#7789;a the modern M√°lkhed the capital of the
later R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as about sixty miles
south-east of Shol√°pur. These details give fair ground for
holding the M√°n√°n&#775;kas to be a family of
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a rulers earlier than that which
appears in the usual genealogy of the later
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a dynasty (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;500&ndash;972).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Main Dynasty, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630&ndash;972.</span>The earliest information
regarding the later R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as is from a
comparatively modern, and therefore not quite trustworthy,
Ch√°lukya copperplate of the eleventh century found by Mr.
Wathen. This plate states that Jayasim&#803;ha I. the earliest
Ch√°lukya defeated the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a
Indra son of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a the lord of 800 elephants. The date of
this battle would be about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;500. If
historic the reference implies that the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as were then a well established
dynasty. In most of their own plates the genealogy of the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as begins with Govinda about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;680. But that Govinda was not the
founder of the family is shown by Dantidurga&rsquo;s Elura
Da&#347;√°vat√°ra inscription (about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750) which gives two earlier names Dantivarmman
and Indra. The founding of R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a power
is therefore of doubtful date. Of the date of its overthrow there is no
question. The overthrow came from the hand of the Western
Ch√°lukya Tailappa in &#346;aka 894 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;972) during the reign of the last
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a Kakka III. or Kakkala.

described by the feudatory title &lsquo;<i lang="sa-latn">Samadhigatapanchmah√°&#347;abdah&#803;</i>&rsquo;

<i lang="sa-latn">Paramabha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka-Mah√°r√°ja</i>
Great Lord Great King, attributes which seem to imply a claim to
independent power. The grant is dated the bright seventh of
&Aacute;&#347;vayuja, &#346;aka 669 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;747). The date is almost contemporary with the
year of Dantidurga in the S√°mangad plate (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;753). As Dantidurga was a very powerful monarch
we may identify the first Kakka of this plate with Kakka I. the
grandfather of Dantidurga and thus trace from Dhruva Kakka&rsquo;s son
a branch of feudatory R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as ruling in
M√°lwa or Gujar√°t, whose leaders were Dhruva, his son
Govinda, and Govinda&rsquo;s son Kakka II. Further Dantidurga&rsquo;s
grant shows that he conquered Central Gujar√°t between the
Mah&iacute; and the Narbad√°<a class="noteref" id="n122.1src"

conquest of Central Gujar√°t seems to have been signalised by
grants of land made by his mother in every village of the M√°tri
division which is apparently the M√°tar t√°luka of the
Kaira district.<a class="noteref" id="n122.3src" href="#n122.3" name="n122.3src">4</a> It is possible that Dantidurga gave conquered
Gujar√°t to his paternal cousin&rsquo;s son and contemporary
Kakka, the grantor of the &Aacute;ntroli plate (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;747), as the representative of a family ruling
somewhere under the overlordship of the main Dakhan
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. Karka&rsquo;s Baroda
grant<a class="noteref" id="n122.4src" href="#n122.4" name="n122.4src">5</a> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812) supports this
theory. Dantidurga died childless and was succeeded by his uncle
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. Of this K&#7771;ish&#7751;a the Baroda grant says
that he assumed the government for the good of the family after having
rooted out a member of the family who had taken to mischief-making. It
seems probable that Kakka II. the grantor of the &Aacute;ntroli plate
is the mischief-maker and that his mischief was, on the death of
Dantidurga, the attempt to secure the succession to himself.
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a frustrated Kakka&rsquo;s attempt and rooted him out
so effectively that no trace of Kakka&rsquo;s family again appears.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and Govinda II.
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;765&ndash;795.</span>From this it
follows that, so far as is known, the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a conquest of Gujar√°t begins
with Dantidurga&rsquo;s conquest of L√°&#7789;a, that is South
Gujar√°t between the Mah&iacute; and the Narbad√°, from the
Gurjjara king Jayabha&#7789;a whose latest known date is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;736 or seventeen years before the known date of
Dantidurga. The Gurjjaras probably retired to the R√°jpipla hills

<p><span class="marginnote">Dhruva I. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;795.</span>Dhruva was a mighty monarch whose
conquests spread from South India as far north as
Allah√°b√°d. During Dhruva&rsquo;s lifetime his son Govinda
probably ruled at May&uacute;rakhandi or Morkhanda in the N√°sik
district and held the Gh√°t country and the Gujar√°t coast
from Bals√°r northwards. Though according to a Kapadvanj grant
Govinda had several brothers the R√°dhanpur (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;808) and Van-Dindori (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;808) grants of his son Govinda III. state that
his father, seeing Govinda&rsquo;s supernatural
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a-like powers, offered him the sovereignty of the
whole world. Govinda declined, saying, The Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik√°
or coast tract already given to me is enough. Seeing that
May&uacute;rakhandi or Morkhanda in N√°sik was Govinda&rsquo;s
capital, this <span class="corr" id="xd25e16041" title="Source: Kan&#7789;hik√°">Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik√°</span>
appears to be the coast from Bals√°r northwards.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Govinda III. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;800&ndash;808.</span>According to Gujar√°t
Govinda&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827&ndash;833)
K√°v&iacute; grant (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827),
finding his power threatened by Stambha and other kings, Dhruva made
the great Govinda independent during his own lifetime. This suggests
that while Dhruva continued to hold the main <span class="corr" id="xd25e16057" title="Source: Rash&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a">R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a</span>
sovereignty in the Dakhan, he probably invested Govinda with the
sovereignty of Gujar√°t. This fact the K√°v&iacute; grant
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827) being a Gujar√°t grant
would rightly mention while it would not find a place in the
R√°dhanpur (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;808) and
Van-Dindori (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;808) grants of the main
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. Of the kings who opposed
Govinda the chief was Stambha who may have some connection with Cambay,
as, during the time of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e16070" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
kings, Cambay came to be called Stambha-t&iacute;rtha instead of by its
old name of Gambh&uacute;t√°. According to the grants the allied
chiefs were no match for Govinda. The Gurjjara fled through fear, not
returning even in dreams, and the M√°lava king submitted. Who the
Gurjjara was it is hard to say. He may have belonged to some Gurjjara
dynasty that rose to importance after Dantidurga&rsquo;s conquest or
the name may mean a ruler of the Gurjjara country. In either case some
North Gujar√°t ruler is meant whose conquest opened the route
from Broach to M√°lwa. From M√°lwa Govinda marched to the
Vindhyas where the king apparently of East M√°lwa named
M√°r√° &#346;arva submitted to Govinda paying tribute. From
the Vindhyas Govinda returned to Gujar√°t passing the rains at
&#346;r&iacute;bhavana,<a class="noteref" id="n123.2src" href="#n123.2"
name="n123.2src">8</a> apparently Sarbhon in the &Aacute;mod
t√°luka of Broach, a favourite locality which he had ruled during
his father&rsquo;s lifetime. After the rains Govinda went south as far
as the Tungabhadra. On starting for the south Govinda handed
Gujar√°t to his brother Indra with whom begins the Gujar√°t
branch of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. Several plates
distinctly mention that Indra was given the kingdom of the lord of
L√°&#7789;a by (his brother) Govinda. Other Gujar√°t
grants, apparently with intent to show that Indra won Gujar√°t
and did not receive it in gift, after mentioning &#346;arvva
Amoghavarsha as the successor of Govinda (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;818), state that the king (apparently of
Gujar√°t) was &#346;arvva&rsquo;s uncle Indra. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>

id="n124.1src" href="#n124.1" name="n124.1src">9</a> the protector of
the <i>mandala</i> of L√°&#7789;a given to him by his lord. An
important verse in an unpublished Baroda grant states that Indra chased
the lord of Gurjjara who had prepared to fight, and that he honourably
protected the multitude of Dakhan (Dakshi&#7751;√°patha)
feudatories (<i>mah√°s√°mantas</i>) whose glory was
shattered by &#346;r&iacute;vallabha (that is &#346;arvva or
Amoghavarsha)<a class="noteref" id="n124.2src" href="#n124.2" name="n124.2src">10</a> then heir-apparent of Govinda. That is, in
attempting to establish himself in independent power, Indra aided
certain of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a feudatories in an
effort to shake off the overlordship of Amoghavarsha.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Karka I. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812&ndash;821.</span>Indra was succeeded by his
son Karka I. who is also called Suvar&#7751;avarsha and
P√°t√°lamalla. Karka reversed his father&rsquo;s policy and
loyally accepted the overlordship of the main
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. Three grants of Karka&rsquo;s
remain, the Baroda grant dated &#346;aka 734 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812), and two unpublished grants from
Navs√°r&iacute; and Surat dated respectively &#346;aka 738
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;816) and &#346;aka 743 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;821). Among Doctor
Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s collection of inscriptions bequeathed
to the British Museum the Baroda grant says that Karka&rsquo;s
<i>sv√°mi</i> or lord, apparently Govinda III., made use of
Karka&rsquo;s arm to protect the king of M√°lava against invasion
by the king of Gurjjara who had become puffed up by conquering the
lords of <span class="corr" id="xd25e16161" title="Source: Gauda">Gau&#7693;a</span> and Vanga that is modern Bengal.
This powerful Gurjjara king who conquered countries so distant as
Bengal has not been identified. He must have been ruling north of the
Mah&iacute; and threatened an invasion of M√°lwa by way of Dohad.
He may have been either a Valabhi king or one of the Bhinm√°l
Gurjjaras, who, during the decline of the Valabhis, and with the help
of their allies the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of <span class="corr"
id="xd25e16165" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
whose leader at this time was Yog R√°ja (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;806&ndash;841), may have extended their dominion
as far south as the Mah&iacute;. As the Baroda plate (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812) makes no mention of Amoghavarsha-&#346;arvva
while the Navs√°r&iacute; plate (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;816) mentions him as the next king after Govinda
III. it follows that Govinda III. died and Amoghavarsha succeeded
between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812 and 816 (&#346;. 734 and
738). This supports Mr. Fleet&rsquo;s conclusion, on the authority of
Amoghavarsha&rsquo;s Sirur inscription, that he came to the throne in
&#346;aka 736 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;814). At first
Amoghavarsha was unable to make head against the opposition of some of
his relations and feudatories, supported, as noted above, by
Karka&rsquo;s father Indra. He seems to have owed his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>

subsequent success to his cousin Karka whom an unpublished Surat grant
and two later grants (&#346;. 757 and &#346;. 789, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;835 and 867) describe as establishing
Amoghavarsha in his own place after conquering by the strength of his
arm arrogant tributary R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as who
becoming firmly allied to each other had occupied provinces according
to their own will.</p>
<p>Karka&rsquo;s Baroda plates (&#346;. 734, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812) record the grant of Baroda itself called
Va&#7693;apadraka in the text. Baroda is easily identified by the
mention of the surrounding villages of Jambuv√°vik√° the
modern J√°mbuv√°da on the east, of Ankottaka the modern
&Aacute;kot√° on the west, and of Vaggh√°chchha perhaps the
modern V√°ghodia on the north. The writer of the grant is
mentioned as the great minister of peace and war Nem√°ditya son
of Durgabha&#7789;&#7789;a, and the D&uacute;taka or grantor is said to
be R√°japutra that is prince Dantivarmman apparently a son of
Karka. The grantee is a Br√°hman originally of Valabhi.</p>
<p>Karka&rsquo;s Navs√°r&iacute; grant (&#346;. 738, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;816) is made from Khe&#7693;√° and records
the gift of the village of Sam&iacute;padraka in the country lying
between the Mah&iacute; and the Narbad√°. The grantee is a South
Indian Br√°hman from B√°d√°mi in Bij√°pur, a
man of learning popularly known as Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita
Vallabhar√°ja because he was proficient in the fourteen
Vidy√°s. The D&uacute;taka of this grant is a South Indian
<i>bha&#7789;a</i> or military officer named the illustrious
Dro&#7751;amma.</p>
<p>Karka&rsquo;s Surat grant (&#346;. 743, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;821) is made from the royal camp on the bank of
the Vankik√° apparently the V√°nki creek near
Bals√°r. It records the grant of a field in
Amb√°p√°taka village near N√°gas√°rika
(Navs√°r&iacute;) to a Jain temple at N√°garik√°,
(Navs√°r&iacute;). The writer of the grant is the minister of war
and peace N√°r√°yana son of Durgabha&#7789;&#7789;a. As
this is the first grant by a Gujar√°t
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a of lands south of the
T√°pti it may be inferred that in return for his support
Amoghavarsha added to Karka&rsquo;s territory the portion of the North
Konkan which now forms Gujar√°t south of the T√°pti.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dantivarmman, Heir
Apparent.</span>According to Karka&rsquo;s Baroda plate (&#346;. 734,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812) Karka had a son named
Dantivarmman who is mentioned as the princely D&uacute;taka of the
plate. The fact of being a D&uacute;taka implies that Dantivarmman was
then of age. That Dantivarmman was a son of Karka is supported by
Ak√°lavarsha&rsquo;s Bagumr√° plate (&#346;. 810,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;888), where, though the plate is
badly composed and the grammar is faulty, certain useful details are
given regarding Dantivarmman who is clearly mentioned as the son of
Karka. Karka had another son named Dhruva, who, according to three
copperplates, succeeded to the throne. But as Dantivarmman&rsquo;s
son&rsquo;s grant is dated &#346;aka 810 or seventy-six years later
than the Baroda plate some error seems to have crept into the genealogy
of the plate. Neither Dantivarmman nor Dhruva seems to have succeeded
their father as according to Govinda&rsquo;s K√°v&iacute; grant
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827) their uncle Govinda succeeded
his brother Karka. The explanation may be that Dantivarmman died during
his father&rsquo;s lifetime, and that some years later, after a great
yearning for a son,<a class="noteref" id="n125.1src" href="#n125.1"

<p><span class="marginnote">Govinda, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827&ndash;833.</span>This Govinda, the brother

plate of Govinda&rsquo;s K√°v&iacute; grant is dated &#346;aka
749 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;827). It gives no details
regarding Govinda. The grant is made from Broach and records the gift
of a village<a class="noteref" id="n126.1src" href="#n126.1" name="n126.1src">12</a> to a temple of the Sun called Jay√°ditya in
Kotipur near K√°pik√° that is K√°v&iacute; thirty
miles north of Broach. The writer of the grant is Yoge&#347;vara son of
Avalokita and the D&uacute;taka or grantor was one Bha&#7789;&#7789;a
Kumuda. As it contains no reference to Govinda&rsquo;s succession the
plate favours the view that Govinda remained in power only during the
minority of his nephew Dhruva.</p>

made from a place called Sarvvamangal√° near Khe&#7693;√°

N√°r√°ya&#7751;a son of Durgabha&#7789;&#7789;a, and the
D&uacute;taka or grantor is the illustrious Devar√°ja. Dhruva
seems to have abandoned his father&rsquo;s position of loyal feudatory
to the main R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. According to a
copperplate dated &#346;aka 832 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;910)
Vallabha that is Amoghavarsha, also called the illustrious great
Skanda, sent an army and besieged and burned the
Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik√° that is the coast tract between Bombay and
Cambay. In the course of this campaign, according to Dhruva II.&rsquo;s
Bagumr√° grant (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 789,

crushed certain intrigues among his relatives or <i>bandhuvarga</i>,
and established himself firmly on the throne. Regarding the troubles at
the beginning of his reign the Bagumr√° plate states that on one
side Vallabha the head of the Dakhan
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as was still against him; on
another side Dhruva had to face an army of Gurjjaras instigated by a
member of his own family<a class="noteref" id="n127.2src" href="#n127.2" name="n127.2src">19</a>; thirdly he was opposed by certain of
his relatives or <i>b√°ndhav√°h&#803;</i>; and lastly he
had to contend against the intrigues of a younger brother or
<i>anuja</i>. It further appears from Dhruva II.&rsquo;s Bagumr√°
plate that he checked an inroad by a Mihira king with a powerful army.
This Mihira king was probably a chief of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Mehrs who on the downfall of the
Valabhis spread their power across Gujar√°t. In all these
troubles the Bagumr√° grant notes that Dhruva was aided by a
younger brother named Govindar√°ja. This Govindar√°ja is
mentioned as appointed by Dhruva the D&uacute;taka of the grant.</p>
<p>Dhruva II.&rsquo;s Bagumr√° (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;867) grant was made at Bh&#7771;igu-Kachchha or
Broach after bathing in the Narbad√°. It records the gift to a

to two Br√°hmans of the village of Kavi&#7789;has√°dhi the
modern Kos√°d four miles north-east of Surat, described as
situated in the Vari√°vi (the modern Vari√°v two miles
north of Surat) sub-division of 116 villages in the province of Konkan.
The grant is said to have been written by the peace and war minister

<p>That Amoghavarsha&rsquo;s long reign lasted till &#346;aka 799
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;877) is clear from the Kanheri cave
inscription already referred to. His reign can hardly have lasted much

independence, Amoghavarsha&rsquo;s relations with the Gujar√°t
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as became extremely hostile and
probably continued hostile till his death (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;877). That Amoghavarsha&rsquo;s son

two Navs√°r&iacute; plates of &#346;aka 836 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;914) which mention his grandfather

Regarding this fight the late R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a

<p>At this time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;910) a grant from
Kapadvanj dated &#346;. 832 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;910) and
published in <abbr title="Epigraphia Indica">Ep. Ind.</abbr> I. 52ff.
states that a <i>mah√°s√°manta</i> or noble of
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a Ak√°lavarsha&rsquo;s named
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a, with his <i>da&#7751;&#7693;an√°yaka</i>
Chandragupta, was in charge of a sub-division of 750 villages in the
Khe&#7693;√° district at Harshapura apparently Harsol near
Par√°ntij. The grant gives the name of
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s family as Br√°hma-vaka (?) and
states that the family gained its fortune or Lakshm&iacute; by the
prowess of the feet of Ak√°lavarsha, showing that the members of
the family drew their authority from Ak√°lavarsha. The grant
mentions four of Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s ancestors, all of whom
have non-Gujar√°t K√°narese-looking names. Though not
independent rulers Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s ancestors seem to have
been high R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a officers. The first is
called &#346;uddha-kkumba&#7693;i, the second his son Dega&#7693;i, the
third Dega&#7693;i&rsquo;s son R√°jaham&#803;sa, the fourth
R√°jaham&#803;sa&rsquo;s son Dhavalappa the father of
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a and Akkuka. The plate describes
R√°jaham&#803;sa as bringing back to his house its flying fortune
as if he had regained lost authority. The plate describes Dhavalappa as
killing the enemy in a moment and then giving to his lord the
Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala or kingdom which the combined enemy, desirous of
glory, had taken. This apparently refers to Ak√°lavarsha&rsquo;s
enemies abandoning Khe&#7789;aka with its Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala as
mentioned in the late R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a
Kard√° plate (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;973). Dhavalappa
is probably Ak√°lavarsha&rsquo;s general who fought and defeated
the roaring Gurjjara, a success which may have led to Dhavalappa being
placed in military charge of Gujar√°t.<a class="noteref" id="n129.2src" href="#n129.2" name="n129.2src">27</a> The Kapadvanj
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;910) grant describes

Bhagv√°nl√°l believed Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a to be a mere
epithet of Akkuka, and took Chandragupta to be another name of the same
person, but the published text gives the facts as above stated. The
grantee is a Br√°hman and the grant is of the village of

Broach.<a class="noteref" id="n129.3src" href="#n129.3" name="n129.3src">28</a> The plate describes Akkuka as gaining glory fighting

that at this time the Sella-Vidy√°dharas, apparently the North

apparently referring to some contemporary Mehr king of North
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Both the Navs√°r&iacute;
plates of &#346;aka 836 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;914) note
that the grants were made under peculiar conditions. The plates say
that the donor Indra Nityam&#803;varsha, with his capital at
M√°nyakheta, had come to a place named Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka for
the <i>pa&#7789;&#7789;abandha</i> or investiture festival. It is
curious that though M√°nyakhe&#7789;a is mentioned as the capital
the king is described as having come to Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka for the
investiture. Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka was apparently not a large town as
the plates mention that it was given in grant.<a class="noteref" id="n130.3src" href="#n130.3" name="n130.3src">32</a> At his investiture
Indra made great gifts. He weighed himself against gold or silver, and
before leaving the scales he gave away Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka and other
places, twenty and a half l√°khs of dramma coins, and 400
villages previously granted but taken back by intervening kings. These
details have an air of exaggeration. At the same time gifts of coins by
<i>l√°khs</i> are not improbable by so mighty a king as Indra and
as to the villages the bulk of them had already been alienated. The
fact of lavish grants is supported by the finding of these two plates
of the same date recording grants of two different villages made on the
same occasion, the language being the same, and also by a verse in the
late R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a Kard√° plate (&#346;.

<blockquote>
<p class="first">[The text does not carry the question of the origin of
the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as beyond the point that, about
the middle of the fifth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, two
tribes bearing the closely associated names R√°tho&#7693; and
Ra&#7789;&#7789;a, the leaders of both of which are known in Sanskrit
as R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as, appeared the first in Upper
India the second in the Bombay Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;ak, and that
the traditions of both tribes seem to show they were either southerners
or foreigners Br√°hmanised and included under the all-embracing
term <span class="corr" id="xd25e16799" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span>. The Sanskrit form
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a may mean either leaders of the
R√°sh&#7789;ra tribe or heads of the territorial division named
<i>r√°shtra</i>. The closely related forms
R√°sh&#7789;rapati and Gr√°mak&uacute;&#7789;a occur (above
page 82) in Valabhi inscriptions. And Mr. Fleet (K√°narese
Dynasties, 32) notices that R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a is
used in the inscriptions of many dynasties as a title equivalent to
R√°sh&#7789;rapati. Such a title might readily become a family
name like that of the S√°hi J√°ts of the Panj√°b or
the Mar√°thi surnames Patel, Nadkarni, and Des√°i. It may
be noted that one of the M√°rw√°r traditions (<span class="corr" id="xd25e16805" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span> Gazetteer,
III. 246) connects the word R√°tho&#7693; with
R√°sh&#7789;ra country making the original form
R√°sh&#7789;ravara or World-blessing and referring to an early
tribal guardian R√°sh&#7789;ra&#347;yena or the World-Falcon. It
is therefore possible that the origin of both forms of the name, of
R√°tho&#7693; as well as of
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a, is the title ruler of a
district. At the same time in the case of the southern
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as the balance of evidence is in
support of a tribal origin of the name. The Ra&#7789;&#7789;as of
Saundatti in Belgaum, apparently with justice, claim descent from the
former R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a rulers (Belgaum Gazetteer,
355). Further that the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as
considered themselves to belong to the Ra&#7789;&#7789;a tribe is shown
by Indra Nityam&#803;varsha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;914)

<span class="sc">The R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as,

himself Ra&#7789;&#7789;akandarpa the Love of the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as.
The result is thus in agreement with the view accepted in the text that
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a means leaders of the
Ra&#7789;&#7789;a tribe, the form R√°sh&#7789;ra being perhaps
chosen because the leaders held the position of
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as or District Headmen. According
to Dr. Bhand√°rkar (Deccan History, 9) the tribal name
Ra&#7789;&#7789;a or R√°sh&#7789;ra enters into the still more
famous Dakhan tribal name Mahar√°tha or Mahr√°tta. So far
as present information goes both the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as and the Great
Ra&#7789;&#7789;as are to be traced to the R√°stikas mentioned in
number five of <span class="corr" id="xd25e16826" title="Source: Asoka&rsquo;s">A&#347;oka&rsquo;s</span> (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;245) Girn√°r edicts among the
Apar√°ntas or westerners along with the Pete&#7751;ikas or people
of Paithan about forty miles north-east of Ahmadnagar (Kolh√°pur
Gazetteer, 82). Whether the R√°stika of the edicts is like
Pete&#7751;ika a purely local name and if so why a portion of the north
Dakhan should be specially known as the country or R√°sh&#7789;ra
are points that must remain open.<a class="noteref" id="n132.1src"
href="#n132.1" name="n132.1src">38</a></p>
<p>The explanation that K&uacute;&#7789;a the second half of
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a, means chief, has been accepted
in the text. This is probably correct. At the same time the rival
theory deserves notice that the name
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a is formed from two tribal names
K&uacute;&#7789;a representing the early widespread tribe allied to the
Gonds known as Ko&#7789;&#7789;as and Ko&#7693;s in the Central
Provinces North Konkan and Delhi (Th√°na Gazetteer, XII. Part II.
414). In support of this view it may be noticed that Abhimanyu&rsquo;s
fifth century R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a inscription (J. Bo.
Br. R. As. XVI. 92) refers to the Ko&#7789;&#7789;as though as enemies
not allies of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. At the same
time certain details in Abhimanyu&rsquo;s grant favour an early
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a settlement in the Central
Provinces, the probable head-quarters of the Ko&#7789;&#7789;as. The
grant is dated from M√°napura and is made to Dakshi&#7751;a
&#346;iva of Pe&#7789;hapan&#775;garaka which may be the Great
&#346;iva shrine in the Mah√°dev hills in
Hoshang√°b√°d, as this shrine is under the management of a
petty chief of a place called Pag√°ra, and as M√°npur in
the Vindhya hills is not far off. Against the tribal origin of the word
K&uacute;&#7789;a is to be set the fact that the northern
Ra&#7789;&#7789;as are also called
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as though any connection between
them and the Ko&#7789;&#7789;a tribe seems unlikely.</p>
<p>The question remains were the southern Ra&#7789;&#7789;as or
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as connected with the northern
R√°tho&#7693;s or R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as. If so
what was the nature of the connection and to what date does it belong.
The fact that, while the later southern
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

themselves Y√°davas of the Lunar race, the northerners claim
descent either from Ku&#347;a the son of R√°ma or from
Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu would seem to prove no connection did not
Abhimanyu&rsquo;s fifth century grant show that in his time the
southern R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as had not begun to claim
Y√°dava descent. That the M√°rw√°r
R√°tho&#7693;s trace their name to the <i>r√°ht</i> or
spine of Indra (Tod&rsquo;s Annals, II. 2), and in a closely similar
fashion the R√°th or Rattu J√°ts of the Sutlej
(Ibbetson&rsquo;s 1881 Census, page 236) explain their name as
stronghanded, and the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as of Bij√°pur
(Bij√°pur Stat. Account, 145) trace their name to the
K√°narese <i>ra&#7789;&#7789;a</i> right arm, may imply no closer
connection than the common attempt to find a meaning for the name
Ra&#7789;&#7789;a in a suitable word of similar sound. A legend
preserved in the R√°jput√°na Gazetteer (III. 246), but not
noted by Tod, tells how Sevji, after (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1139) the Musalm√°ns drove his father
Jaichand out of Kanauj (Tod&rsquo;s Annals, I. 88) took Khergad from
the Gehlots and went to the Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;ak. where the
R√°tho&#7693;s had ruled before they came to Kanauj. From the
Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;ak Sevji brought the image of the
R√°hto&#7693; R√°sh&#7789;ra&#347;yena which is now in the
temple of N√°g√°na in Mev√°&#7693;. The account
quoted in the text from Tod (Annals, I. 88) that the
R√°tho&#7693;s who rose to power in M√°rw√°r in the
thirteenth century belonged to a royal family who had held Kanauj since
the fifth century has not stood the test of recent inquiry. It is now
known that about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470 Kanauj was in
the hands of the Gupt√°s. That about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600, according to the contemporary
&#346;r&iacute;harshacharita it was ruled by the Maukhari
Grahavarm√°n who was put to death by a M√°lwa chief and was
succeeded by Harsha. About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750,
according to the R√°j√°taran&#775;gin&iacute;, Kanauj was
held by Ya&#347;ovarm√°n, and, in the next century, as
inscriptions prove by the family of Bhoja. It was not till about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1050 that Kanauj was occupied by the
G√°hadav√°la or G√°harw√°la family from whom
the R√°tho&#7693;s of M√°rw√°r claim
descent.<a class="noteref" id="n133.1src" href="#n133.1" name="n133.1src">39</a> If the legendary connection of the
M√°rw√°r R√°tho&#7693;s with Kanauj must be dismissed
can the M√°rw√°r R√°tho&#7693;s be a branch of the
southern R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as who like the
Mar√°th√°s some 800 years later spread conquering
northwards? Such a northern settlement of the southern
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as might be a consequence of the
victories of the great R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a Dhruva who
according to received opinions about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;790 conquered as far north as
Allah√°b√°d. It is beyond question that southerners or
Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;as were settled in North India between the
seventh and the eleventh centuries. Still the latest information makes
it improbable that Dhruva&rsquo;s conquests extended further north than
Gujar√°t. Nor has any special connection been traced between the
southern R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as and the middle-age
settlements of southerners or Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;as in North
India.<a class="noteref" id="n133.2src" href="#n133.2" name="n133.2src">40</a> Must therefore the North Indian tribe of

<span class="sc">The R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;743&ndash;974.</span></span> as late
as the twelfth century, and further is the North Indian name
R√°tho&#7693; not tribal but derived from the title head of a
district. Several considerations make both of these solutions unlikely
if not impossible. First there is the remarkably widespread existence
of the name R√°htor, Ratha, or Ratti, and endless variations of
these names, in almost all parts of the Panj√°b, among all castes
from the Br√°hman to the Baluch, among all religions
Musalm√°n, Sikh, Jain, and Br√°hmanic.<a class="noteref"
id="n134.1src" href="#n134.1" name="n134.1src">41</a> No doubt the
practice of a waning tribe adopting the name of a waxing tribe has
always been common. No doubt also the fame of the name during the last
600 years must have tempted other classes to style themselves
R√°tho&#7693;. Still it is to be noted: first that (Ibbetson,
page 240) the R√°tho&#7693;s of the Panj√°b though
widespread are not numerous: and second that the list of
sub-caste-names has this merit that with a few exceptions the holders
of the sub-name are not known by it but by some general or craft name.
The evidence of these sub-caste or tribal names seems therefore to
support the view that some very large section of the Panj√°b
population represent an important tribe or nation of whom the least
mixed remnant are perhaps the R√°this or lower class
R√°jputs of K√°ngra and Chamba (Ibbetson, pages 219 and
251) and from some connection with whom the M√°rw√°r
R√°tho&#7693;s of the thirteenth century may have taken their
name. Among other traces of northern R√°sh&#7789;ras in the
middle ages may be mentioned the twelfth and thirteenth century
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as of Badaun in the North-West
Provinces (Kielhorn in Epigraphia Indica, I. 61 and 63) and
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1150) in the
Kum√°rap√°la-Charitra (Tod&rsquo;s Western India, 182) the
mention of R√°sh&#7789;ra-de&#347;a near the Saw√°lak
hills. Among earlier and more doubtful references are the Aratrioi whom
probably correctly (since at that time <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247 one main Roman trade route to Central Asia
passed up the Indus) the author of the Periplus (McCrindle, 120) places
between Abhiria or lower Sindh and Arachosia or south-east
Afghanist√°n that is in north Sindh or south Panj√°b.
Another earlier and still more doubtful reference is Pliny&rsquo;s
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;77) Oratur&aelig; (<abbr>Hist.
Nat.</abbr> VI. 23) whom Vivien de St. Martin (<span lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque et Latine de l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 203)
identifies with the R√°tho&#7693;s. The fact that while claiming
descent from R√°ma the M√°rw√°r R√°tho&#7693;s
(Tod&rsquo;s Annals, II. 2 and 5) preserved the legend that their
founder was Yavana&#347;wa from the northern city of Paralipur supports
the view that the tribe to which they belonged was of non-Indian or
Central Asian origin, and that this is the tribe of whom traces remain
in the R√°thi R√°jputs of the K√°ngra hill country
and less purely in the widely spread R√°ts, Rattas, and
R√°tis of the Panj√°b plains. The examples among
Panj√°b caste names Rora for Arora (Ibbetson&rsquo;s 1881 Census,
page 297), Her for Ahir (Ditto, 230&ndash;275), and Heri for Aheri
(Ditto, 310) suggest that the Panj√°b R√°thors or
Ra&#7789;&#7789;as may be the ancient Ara&#7789;&#7789;as whom the
Mah√°bh√°rata (<abbr title="Chapter">Chap.</abbr> VII.
Verse 44. <abbr>J. Bl. Soc.</abbr> VI. <abbr title="Part">Pt.</abbr> I.
387 and Vivien de St. Martin <span lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque
et Latine de l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 149) ranks with Prasthalas, Madras,
and Gandh√°ras, Panj√°b and frontier tribes, whose
identification with the B√°hikas (Kar&#7751;aparvan, 2063ff.)
raises the probability of a common Central Asian origin. Remembering
that the evidence (Kshatrapa Chapter, pages 22 and 33) favours the view
that the Kshatrapa family who ruled the Panj√°b between
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;70 and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 were of the same tribe as Nah√°pana, and
also that Sh√°hi is so favourite a prefix in Samudra
Gupta&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;380) list of
Kush√°n tribes, the suggestion may be offered that
Kshahar√°ta is the earlier form of Sh√°hara&#7789;&#7789;a
and is the tribe of foreigners afterwards known in the Panj√°b as
Ara&#7789;&#7789;as and of which traces survive in the present
widespread tribal names R√°ta, Ratta, Ratha, and
R√°thor.]</p>

Chapter XII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mers, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;900.</span></span> That the Guptas held
sway in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a till the time of
Skandagupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;454&ndash;470) is proved
by the fact that his Sorath Viceroy is mentioned in Skandagupta&rsquo;s
inscription on the Girn√°r rock. After Skandagupta under the next
known Gupta king Budhagupta (Gupta 165&ndash;180, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;484&ndash;499) no trace remains of Gupta
sovereignty in Sorath. It is known that Budhagupta was a weak king and
that the Gupta kingdom had already entered on its decline and lost its
outlying provinces. Who held Sur√°sh&#7789;ra and Gujar√°t
during the period of Gupta decline until the arrival and settlement of
Bha&#7789;k√°rka in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;514 (Gupta
195) is not determined. Still there is reason to believe that during or
shortly after the time of Budhagupta some other race or dynasty
overthrew the Gupta Viceroy of these provinces and took them from the
Guptas. These powerful conquerors seem to be the tribe of Maitrakas
mentioned in Valabhi copperplates as people who had settled in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and established a
<i>ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</i> or kingdom. Though these Maitrakas are
mentioned in no other records from Sur√°sh&#7789;ra there seems
reason to identify the Maitrakas with the Mihiras the well-known tribe
of Mhers or Mers. In Sanskrit both <i>mitra</i> and <i>mihira</i> are
names of the sun, and it would be quite in agreement with the practise
of Sanskrit writers to use derivatives of the one for those of the
other. These Mhers or Mers are still found in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a settled round the Barda hills
while the Porbandar chiefs who are known as Jethv√°s are
recognized as the head of the tribe. The name Jethv√° is not a
tribal but a family name, being taken from the proper or personal name
of the ancestor of the modern chiefs. As the Porbandar chiefs are
called the kings of the Mhers they probably belong to the same tribe,
though, being chiefs, they try, like other ruling families, to rank
higher than their tribe tracing their origin from
Han&uacute;m√°n. Though the Jethv√°s appear to have been
long ashamed to acknowledge themselves to belong to the Mher tribe the
founders of minor Mher kingdoms called themselves Mher
kings<span class="corr" id="xd25e17221" title="Not in source">.</span>
The Porbandar chiefs have a tradition tracing their dynasty to
Makaradhvaja son of Han&uacute;m√°n, and there are some
<span class="corr" id="xd25e17224" title="Source: Pur√°nik">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> legends attached
to the tradition. The historical kernel of the tradition appears to be
that the Mhers or Jethv√°s had a <i>makara</i> or fish as their
flag or symbol. One of the mythical stories of Makaradhvaja is that he
fought with May&uacute;radhvaja. Whatever coating of fable may have
overlaid the story, it contains a grain of history. May&uacute;radhvaja
stands for the Guptas whose chief symbol was a peacock
<i>may&uacute;ra</i>, and with them Makaradhvaja that is the people
with the fish-symbol that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter XII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mers, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;900.</span></span> the Mhers had a
fight. This fight is probably the historical contest in which the Mhers
fought with and overthrew the Gupta Viceroy of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.</p>
<p>The K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a Mhers are a peculiar tribe
whose language dress and appearance mark them as foreign settlers from
Upper India. Like the M√°lavas, J√°ts, <span class="corr"
id="xd25e17250" title="Source: Gurjaras">Gurjjaras</span>, and
Pahlavas, the Mhers seem to have passed through the Punj√°b Sindh
and North Gujar√°t into K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
leaving settlements at Ajm&iacute;r, B√°dner, Jesalm&iacute;r,
Kokalm&iacute;r, and Mherv√°&#7693;a. How and when the Mhers made
these settlements and entered K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a is
not known. It may be surmised that they came with Toram√°&#7751;a
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;512) who overthrew the
Guptas, and advanced far to the south and west in the train of some
general of Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s who may perhaps have entered
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra. This is probable as the date of
Toram√°&#7751;a who overthrew Budhagupta is almost the same as
that of the Maitrakas mentioned as the opponents and enemies of
Bha&#7789;√°rka. In the time of Bha&#7789;√°rka
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;520?) the Mhers were
firmly established in the peninsula, otherwise they would not be
mentioned in the Valabhi grants as enemies of Bha&#7789;√°rka, a
tribe or <i>ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</i> wielding incomparable power. As
stated above in Chapter VIII. some time after the Mher settlement and
consolidation of power, Bha&#7789;√°rka seems to have come as
general of the fallen Guptas through M√°lwa and Broach by sea to
East K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. He established himself at
Valabhi and then gradually dislodged the Mhers from Sorath until they
retired slightly to the north settling eventually at Morbi, which the
Jethv√°s still recognize as the earliest seat of their ancestors.
At Morbi they appear to have ruled contemporarily with the Valabhis. In
support of this it is to be noted that no known Valabhi plate records
any grant of lands or villages in H√°l√°r,
Machhuk√°ntha, or Okh√°mandal in North
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. As the northmost place mentioned
in Valabhi plates is Venuthali known as Wania&rsquo;s Vanthali in
H√°l√°r it may be inferred that not the Valabhis but the
Mhers ruled the north coast of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a,
probably as feudatories or subordinates of the Valabhis. On the
overthrow of Valabhi about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;770 the
Mhers appear to have seized the kingdom and ruled the whole of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a dividing it into separate
chiefships grouped under the two main divisions of Bard√°i and
Gohelv√°dia. About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;860 the
Mhers made incursions into Central Gujar√°t. A copperplate dated
&#346;aka 789 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;847) of the
Gujar√°t R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a king Dhruva
describes him as attacked by a powerful Mihira king whom he
defeated.<a class="noteref" id="n136.1src" href="#n136.1" name="n136.1src">1</a> At the height of their power the Mhers seem to have
established their capital at the fort of Bhumli or Ghumli in the
Bard√° hills in the centre of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. The traditions about Ghumli rest
mainly on modern Jethv√° legends of no historical interest. The
only known epigraphical record is a copperplate of a king named
J&acirc;chikadeva found in the Morbi district.<a class="noteref" id="n136.2src" href="#n136.2" name="n136.2src">2</a> Unfortunately only
the second plate remains. Still the fish mark on the plate, the
locality where it was found, and its date <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter XII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mers, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;900.</span></span> leave little doubt
that the plate belongs to the Makaradhvaja or Jethv√° kings. The
date of the grant is 585 Gupta era the 5th Ph√°lguna Sudi that is
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;904, about 130 years after the
destruction of Valabhi, a date with which the form of the letters
agrees.</p>
<p>A similar copperplate in which the king&rsquo;s name appears in the
slightly different form J√°ikadeva has been found at Dhiniki in
the same neighbourhood as the first and like it bearing the fish
mark.<a class="noteref" id="n137.1src" href="#n137.1" name="n137.1src">3</a> This copperplate describes the king as ruling at
Bh&uacute;milik√° or Bh&uacute;mli in Sorath and gives him the
high titles of <span lang="sa-latn">Parama-bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka-Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja-Parame&#347;vara</span>,
that is Great Lord Great King of Kings Great King, titles which imply
wide extent and independence of rule. This grant purports to be made on
the occasion of a solar eclipse on Sunday Vikrama Sam&#803;vat 794

no-moon of the second half of K√°rttika. This would be
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738 or 166 years before the
J√°chika of the Morb&iacute; plate. Against this it is to be
noted that the letters of this plate, instead of appearing as old as
eighth century letters, look later than the letters of the tenth
century Morb&iacute; plate. As neither the day of the week, the
constellation, nor the eclipse work out correctly Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l believed the plate to be a forgery of the
eleventh century, executed by some one who had seen a fish-marked
copperplate of J√°chika dated in the <i>&#346;aka</i> era. It
should however be noted that the names of ministers and officers which
the plate contains give it an air of genuineness. Whether the plate is
or is not genuine, it is probably true that <span class="corr" id="xd25e17320" title="Source: J√°ikadev">J√°ikadeva</span>
was a great independent sovereign ruling at Bh&uacute;mli. Though the
names of the other kings of the dynasty, the duration of the
Bh&uacute;mli kingdom, and the details of its history are unknown it
may be noted that the dynasty is still represented by the Porbandar
chiefs. Though at present Bh&uacute;mli is deserted several ruined
temples of about the eleventh century stand on its site. It is true no
old inscriptions have been found; it is not less true that no careful
search has been made about Bh&uacute;mli.</p>
<p>Early in the tenth century a wave of invasion from Sindh seems to
have spread over Kacch and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Among
the invading tribes were the J√°dej√°s of Kacch and the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e17325" title="Source: Chu&#7693;√°sam√°s">Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s</span>
of Sorath, who like the Bhattis of Jesalm&iacute;r call themselves of
the Yaduvam&#803;&#347;a stock. Doctor Bhagv√°nl√°l held
that the <span class="corr" id="xd25e17328" title="Source: Ch&uacute;&#7693;asam√°s">Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s</span>
were originally of the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra tribe, as their traditions
attest <span class="corr" id="xd25e17331" title="Source: connexion">connection</span> with the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ras
and as the description of Graharipu one of their kings by Hemachandra
in his Dvy√°&#347;raya points to his being of some local tribe
and not of any ancient R√°jput lineage. Further in their bardic
traditions as well as in popular stories the
Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s are still commonly called
&Aacute;hera-r√°n√°s. The position of Aberia in Ptolemy
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150) seems to show that in the
second century the Ahirs were settled between Sindh and the
Panj√°b. Similarly it may be suggested that J√°dej√°
is a corruption of Jaudhej√° which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter XII.<br>
<span class="sc">The Mers, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;900.</span></span> in turn comes from
Yaudheya (the change of <i>y</i> to <i>j</i> being very common) who in
Kshatrapa Inscriptions appear as close neighbours of the Ahirs. After
the fall of the Valabhis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;775) the
Yaudheyas seem to have established themselves in Kacch and the Ahirs
settled and made conquests in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. On
the decline of local rule brought about by these incursions and by the
establishment of an Ahir or Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°
kingdom at Jun√°ga&#7693;h, the Jethv√°s seem to have
abandoned Bh&uacute;mli which is close to Jun√°ga&#7693;h and
gone to Sr&iacute;nagar or K√°&#7751;telun near Porbandar which
is considered to have been the seat of Jethv√° power before
Porbandar.</p>
<p>A copperplate found at Hadd√°l√° on the road from Dholka
to Dhandhuka dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;917 (&#346;aka
839) shows that there reigned at Vadhw√°n a king named
Dhara&#7751;&iacute;var√°ha of the Ch√°pa dynasty,<a class="noteref" id="n138.1src" href="#n138.1" name="n138.1src">4</a> who
granted a village to one Mahesvar√°ch√°rya, an apostle of
the &Aacute;mard√°ka &#346;√°kh√° of <span class="corr" id="xd25e17381" title="Source: Saivism">&#346;aivism</span>.
Dhara&#7751;&iacute;var√°ha and his ancestors are described as
feudatory kings, ruling by the grace of the feet of the great king of
kings the great lord the illustrious Mah&iacute;p√°ladeva. This
Mah&iacute;p√°la would seem to be some great king of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a reigning in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;917 over the greater part of the province. Dr.
Bhagv√°nl√°l had two coins of this king of about that time,
one a copper coin the other a silver coin. The coins were found near
Jun√°ga&#7693;h. The copper coin, about ten grains in weight, has
one side obliterated but the other side shows clearly the words
R√°n√° &#346;r&iacute; Mah&iacute;p√°la Deva. The
silver coin, about fourteen grains in weight, has on the obverse a
well-executed elephant and on the reverse the legend R√°n√°
&#346;r&iacute; Mah&iacute;p√°la Deva. From the locality where
the name Mah&iacute;p√°la appears both in coins and inscriptions,
and from the fact that the more reliable
Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√° lists contain similar names, it
may be assumed as probable that Mah&iacute;p√°la was a powerful
Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√° ruler of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a in the early part of the tenth
century.</p>
<p>After the fall of Valabhi no other reliable record remains of any
dynasty ruling over the greater part of Gujar√°t. The most
trustworthy and historical information is in connection with the
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of A&#7751;ahilapura. Even for the
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s nothing is available but scant references
recorded by Jain authors in their histories of the Solan&#775;kis and
V√°ghel√°s.</p>

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;900&ndash;940.</span>
(K√°thi√°w√°r Gazetteer, 489). Traces of a different
tradition are to be found in the Tuhfat-ul-Kir√°m (Elliot, I.
337) which gives a list of <span class="corr" id="xd25e17427" title="Source: Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°samm√°&rsquo;s">Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°&rsquo;s</span>

the Y√°dava but also R√°ma of the solar line. In this
pedigree the Musalm√°n element is later than the others: but the
attempt to combine the solar and lunar lines is a sure sign that the
Samma clan was not of Hindu origin, and that it came under Hindu
influence fairly late though before Sindh became a Musalm√°n
province. This being admitted it follows that the Sammas were one of
the numerous tribes that entered India during the existence of the
Turkish empire in Transoxiana (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;560&ndash;c. 750). In this connection it is
noteworthy that some of the J√°ms bore such Turkish names as
Tam√°chi, Tughlik, and Sanj√°r.</p>
<p>The migration of the Sammas to Kacch is ascribed by the
Tar&iacute;kh-i-Tahiri (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1621) to the
tyranny of the S&uacute;mra chiefs. The Sammas found Kacch in the
possession of the Ch√°waras, who treated them kindly, and whom
they requited by seizing the fort of G&uacute;ntr&iacute; by a
stratagem similar to that which brought about the fall of
Girn√°r.</p>
<p>The date of the Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√° settlement at
Vanthal&iacute; is usually fixed on traditional evidence, at about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;875, but there is reason to think
that this date is rather too early. In the first place it is worthy of
notice that Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°chandra, the traditional eponym of
the family, is in the Tuhfat-ul-Kir√°m made a son of J√°dam
(Y√°dava) and only a great-grandson of <span class="corr" id="xd25e17448" title="Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>
himself, a fact which suggests that, if not entirely mythical, he was
at all events a very distant ancestor of M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s
opponent Grah√°ri, and was not an actual ruler of
Vanthal&iacute;. As regards Grah√°ri&rsquo;s father
Vi&#347;vavar√°ha and his grandfather M&uacute;lar√°ja,
there is no reason to doubt that they were real persons, although it is
very questionable whether the Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s
were settled in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a in their time. In
the first place, the Morb&iacute; grant of J√°ikadeva shows that
the Jethv√°s had not been driven southwards before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;907. Secondly
Dhara&#7751;&iacute;var√°ha&rsquo;s Vadhv√°n grant proves
that the Ch√°pa family of Bh&iacute;nm√°l were still
supreme in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;914: whereas the Tar&iacute;kh-i-Tahiri&rsquo;s
account of the Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√° conquest of Kacch
implies that the Ch√°waras, who must be identified with the
Ch√°pas of Bh&iacute;nm√°l, were losing their power when
the Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s captured
G&uacute;ntr&iacute;, an event which must have preceded the settlement
at Vanthal&iacute; in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Beyond the
fact that M&uacute;lar√°ja Solan&#775;ki transferred the capital
to <span class="corr" id="xd25e17457" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;942, we know nothing of the events
which led to the break-up of the Bh&iacute;nm√°l empire. But it
is reasonable to suppose that between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;920 and 940 the Ch√°pas gradually lost
ground and the Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°s were able first to
conquer Sindh and then to settle in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.&mdash;A. M. T. J.]</p>
<p>[K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a contains three peculiar and
associated classes of Hindus, the Mers, the Jethv√°s, and the
Jh√°l√°s. The Mers and the Jethv√°s stand to each
other in the relation of vassal and lord. The Jh√°l√°s are

the sixth century. Though their defeat by Yesodharmman of <span class="corr" id="xd25e17807" title="Source: M√°lw√°">M√°lwa</span> about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;540 at the battle of Karur, sixty miles east of
Mult√°n, may have ended H&uacute;&#7751;a supremacy in north and
north-west India it does not follow that authority at once forsook the
H&uacute;&#7751;as. Their widespread and unchallenged dominion in North
India, the absence of record of any reverse later than the Karur
defeat, the hopelessness of any attempt to pass out of India in the
face of the combined Turk and Sassanian forces make it probable that
the H&uacute;&#7751;as and their associated tribes, adopting Hinduism
and abandoning their claim to supremacy, settled in west and north-west
India. This view finds support in the leading place which the
H&uacute;&#7751;as and H√°ra-H&uacute;&#7751;as, the Maitrakas or
Mers, and the Gurjjaras hold in the centuries that follow the overthrow
of the White H&uacute;&#7751;a empire. According to one rendering of
Cosmas<a class="noteref" id="n143.2src" href="#n143.2" name="n143.2src">22</a> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;525) the chief of
Orrhotha or Sorath in common with several other coast rulers owed
allegiance to Gollas, apparently, as is suggested at page 75 of the
text, to Gulla or Mihirgulla the Indian Emperor of the White
H&uacute;&#7751;as. These details support the view that the Maitrakas,
Mihiras, or Mers who in Cosmas&rsquo; time were in power in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, and to whose ascendancy during
the seventh and eighth centuries both the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang

found in power a cognate tribe of northerners whose date of settlement
on the Indian frontier was less than a century old. This preceding

about the close of the fourth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;380), had driven from Balkh southwards into the

doubtful. Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd25e17587" title="Source: Bhangv√°nl√°l">Bhagv√°nl√°l</span> in
the text (21 Note 6 and 33) distinguishes between the Mevas or Medas
whom he identifies as northern immigrants of about the first century
<span class="sc">b.c.</span> and the Mers. This view is in agreement
with the remark in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e17593" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span> Gazetteer, I.
66, that the Mers have been suspected to be a relic of the
Indo-Skythian Meds. Again Tod (Annals of Rajasth√°n, I. 9)
derives Mev√°&#7693;a from <i>madhya</i> (Sk.) middle, and the
Mer of Merw√°&#7693;a from <i>meru</i> a hill. In support of
Tod&rsquo;s view it is to be noted that the forts Balmer Jesalmer
Komalmer and Ajmer, which Pandit Bhagv√°nl√°l would derive
from the personal names of Mer leaders, are all either hill forts or
rocks (Annals, I. 11, and Note &dagger;). It is, on the other hand, to
be noted that no hill forts out of this particular tract of country are
called Mers, and that the similar names Koli and Malava, which with
equal probability as Medh might be derived from Koh and Mala hill, seem
to be tribal not geographical names.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n140.8src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n141.1"
href="#n141.1src" name="n141.1">14</a></span> The tales cited in the
R√°s M√°l√° (I. 103) prove that most of the Kolis
between Gujar√°t and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a are
Mairs. That till the middle of the tenth century the south-east of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a was held by Medhs (K√°th.
Gazetteer, 672) supports the view that the Kolis, whom about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1190 (Tod&rsquo;s Western India, I.
265) the Gohils drove out of the island of Piram, were Medhs, and this
is in agreement with <span class="corr" id="xd25e17628" title="Source: Idris&iacute;">Idr&iacute;si</span> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1130 Elliot, I. 83) who calls both Piram and the
Medhs by the name Mand. Similarly some of the Koli clans of Kacch
(Gazetteer, 70) seem to be descended from the Medhs. And according to
Mr. Dalpatram Khakkar three subdivisions of Brahmo-Kshatris, of which
the best known are the Mansura Mers and the Pipalia Mers, maintain the
surname Mair or Mer. (Cutch Gazetteer, 52 note 2.) Mera or Mehra is a
common surname among Sindhi Baluchis. Many of the best Musalm√°n
captains and pilots from K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, Kacch,
and the Makr√°n coast still have Mer as a surname. Mehr is also a
favourite name among both Khoj√°hs and Memans, the two special
classes of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a converts to
Isl√°m. The Khoj√°hs explain the name as meaning Meher Ali
the friend of Ali; the Memans also explain Mer as Meher or friend. But
as among Memans Mer is a common name for women as well as for men the
word can hardly mean friend. The phrase Merba&iacute; or Lady Mer
applied to Meman mothers seems to have its origin in the R√°jput
practice of calling the wife by the name of her caste or tribe as
K√°thi√°n&iacute;ba&iacute;, Meran&iacute;ba&iacute;. In
the case both of the Khoj√°hs and the Memans the name Mer seems
to be the old tribal name continued because it yielded itself to the
uses of Isl√°m. Mehr, Mihr, and Mahar are also used as titles of
respect. The Kh√°nt Kolis of Girn√°r, apparently a mixture
of the Maitrakas of the text and of a local hill tribe, still
(K√°thi√°w√°r Gazetteer, 142) honour their leaders
with the name Mer explaining the title by the Gujar√°ti mer the
main bead in a rosary. Similarly in <span class="corr" id="xd25e17634"
title="Source: M√°lw√°">M√°lwa</span> a Gurjjara
title is Mihr (R√°jput√°na Gazetteer, I. 80) and in the
Panj√°b M√°har (Gazetteer of <span class="corr" id="xd25e17637" title="Source: Panjab">Panj√°b</span>,
Gujr√°t, 50&ndash;51). And in Kacch the headman among the
Bharw√°ds, who according to some accounts are Gurjjar√°s,
is called Mir (Cutch Gazetteer, 81). Similarly among the Rab√°ris
of Kacch the name of the holy she-camel is M√°ta Meri. (Ditto,
80.) All these terms of respect are probably connected with Mihira,
Sun.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n141.1src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n141.2"

India, 420): Though enrolled among the thirty-six royal races we may
assert the Jethv√°s have become Hindus only from locality and
circumstance. Of the Jh√°l√°s Tod says (Rajasth√°n,
I. 113): As the Jh√°l√°s are neither Solar Lunar nor
Agnikula they must be strangers. Again (Western India, 414): The
Jh√°l√° Makv√°n√°s are a branch of
H&uacute;&#7751;as. Of the name Makv√°na
(K√°thi√°w√°r Gazetteer, 111; R√°s
M√°l√°, I. 297) two explanations may be offered, either
that the word comes from M√°k the dewy tracts in Central Kacch
(Cutch Gazetteer, 75 note 2) where (K√°thi√°w√°r
Gazetteer, 420) the Jh√°l√°s stopped when the Mers and
Jethv√°s passed south, or that Makv√°na represents Mauna a

H&uacute;&#7751;as (Wilson&rsquo;s Works, IV. 207). Tod&rsquo;s and
Wilford&rsquo;s (Asiatic Researches, IX. 287) suggestion that
Makv√°na is Mah√°huna is perhaps not phonetically possible.
At the same time that the <span class="corr" id="xd25e17648" title="Source: M√°kv√°nas">Makv√°n√°s</span> are a
comparatively recent tribe of northerners is supported by the
ascendancy in the fourteenth century in the Him√°layas of
Makv√°nis (Hodgson&rsquo;s Essays, I. 397; Government of India
Selections XLVII. 54 and 119) who used the Indo-Skythian title
S√°h (Ditto). With the Nepal Makv√°nis may be compared the

Indica, III. 327 and note 12) would identify Mihirakula&rsquo;s tribe
with the Maitrakas. More recent evidence shows that his and his father
<span class="corr" id="xd25e17698" title="Source: Toroma&#7751;a&rsquo;s">Toram√°&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span>
tribe was the J√°uvlas. That the White H&uacute;&#7751;as or
other associated tribes were sun-worshippers appears from a reference
in one of Mihirakula&rsquo;s inscriptions (<span lang="la">Corpus
Inscriptionum Indicarum</span>, III. 161) to the building of a
specially fine temple of the sun; and from the fact that in
Kashm&iacute;r Mihirakula founded a city Mihirapura and a temple to
Mihireshwar. (Darmsteter in Journal Asiatique, X. 70: Fleet in Indian
Antiquary, XV. 242&ndash;252.) Mihirakula&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;508&ndash;530) sun-worship may have been the
continuance of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e17707" title="Source: Kushan">Kush√°n</span> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;50&ndash;150) worship of Mithro or Helios
(Wilson&rsquo;s Ariana Antiqua, 357). At the same time the fact that
Mihirakula uses the more modern form Mihir makes it probable (Compare
Rawlinson&rsquo;s Seventh Monarchy, 284) that Mihirakula&rsquo;s
sun-worship was more directly the result of the spread of sun-worship
in Central Asia under the fiercely propagandist Sassanians Varahan V.
or Behram Gor (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;420&ndash;440), and
his successors Izdigerd II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;440&ndash;457), and Perozes (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;457&ndash;483). The extent to which Zoroastrian
influence pervaded the White H&uacute;&#7751;as is shown by the Persian
name not only of Mihirakula but of Kushnawaz (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;470&ndash;490) the great emperor of the White
H&uacute;&#7751;as the overthrower of Perozes. That this Indian
sun-worship, which, at latest, from the seventh to the tenth century
made Mult√°n so famous was not of local origin is shown by the
absence of reference to sun-worship in Mult√°n in the accounts of
Alexander the Great. Its foreign origin is further shown by the fact
that in the time of Beruni (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1020
Sachau&rsquo;s Edition, I. 119) the priests were called Maghas and the
image of the sun was clad in a northern dress falling to the ankles. It
is remarkable as illustrating the Hindu readiness to adopt priests of
conquering tribes into the ranks of Br√°hmans that the surname
Magha survives (Cutch Gazetteer, 52 note 2) among Shrim√°li
Br√°hmans. These Maghas are said to have married Bhoja or
<span class="corr" id="xd25e17729" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> girls and to have become the
Br√°hman Bhojaks of Dw√°rka. Even the Mands who had
&#346;aka wives, whose descendants were named Mandagas, obtained a
share in the temple ceremonies. Reinaud&rsquo;s <span lang="fr">M&eacute;moire Sur l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 393.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n142.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

explained in the Bhavishya Pur√°na as derived from their
ancestress a daughter of the sage Rigu or Rijvahva of the race named
Mihira (Reinaud&rsquo;s <span lang="fr">M&eacute;moire Sur
l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 393; Wilson&rsquo;s Works, X. 382). The name
Mihiraga suggests that the spread of sun-worship in the Panj√°b
and Sindh, of which the sun-worship in Mult√°n Sindh
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Mew√°&#7693; and the
fire-worshipping <span class="corr" id="xd25e17765" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> and Sindh coins of the fifth and
sixth centuries are evidence, was helped by the spread of Sassanian
influence into Baluchist√°n Kacch-Gandevi and other parts of
western Sindh, through Sakastene the modern western Seistan near the
lake Helmund. This Sakastene or land of the &#346;akas received its
name from the settlement in it of one of the earlier waves of the
Yuechi in the second or first century before Christ. The name explains
the statement in the Bhavishya Pur√°na that sun-worship was
introduced by Magas into Mult√°n from Sakadvipa the land of the
&#346;akas. In this connection it is interesting to note that
Darmsteter (Zend Avesta, xxxiv.) holds that the Zend Avesta was
probably completed during the reign of Sh√°hpur II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;309&ndash;379): that (lxxxix.) Zend was a
language of eastern Persia an earlier form of Pashtu; and that
(lxxxiv.) western Seistan and the Helmund river was the holy land of
the Avesta the birth-place of Zoroaster and the scene of king
Vishtasp&rsquo;s triumphs. A memory of the spread of this western or
Sassanian influence remains in the reference in the
Mujmalu-T-Taw√°rikh in Elliot, I. 107&ndash;109, to the fire
temples established in Kandabil (Gandevi) and Buddha (Mansura) by Mahra
a general of Bahman that is of Varahran V. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;420&ndash;440). It seems probable that Mahra is
Mehr the family name or the title (Rawlinson&rsquo;s Sassanian
Monarchy, 224 note 4 and 312) of the great Mihran family of Persian
nobles. The general in question may be the Mehr-Narses the minister of
Varahran&rsquo;s son and successor Izdigerd II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;440&ndash;457), who enforced Zoroastrianism in
Armenia (Rawlinson, Ditto 305&ndash;308). Mehr&rsquo;s success may be
the origin of the Indian stories of Varahran&rsquo;s visit to
<span class="corr" id="xd25e17780" title="Source: M√°lw√°">M√°lwa</span>. It may further be
the explanation of the traces of fire temples and towers of silence

Jethv√°s have all the appearance of Skythian descent. As they
make no pretension to belong to any of the old Indian races they may be
a branch of Skythians. In his Western India (page 412), though confused
by his identification of &#346;√°nkha-dw√°ra with Sakotra
instead of with Bet-Dw√°rka (compare K√°th. Gaz. 619), Tod

&ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; by the Arabs, names the Ch√°vo&#7789;akas
next after the kings of Kacch and Saur√°sh&#7789;ra. These
Ch√°vo&#7789;akas can be no other than the
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar on the borders
of Kacch. The Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar
do not appear to have been important rulers. At the most they seem to
have held Vadhi√°r and part of the north coast of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Whatever be the origin of the
name Ch√°va&#7693;√°, which was afterwards Sanskritised
into the highsounding Ch√°po&#7789;ka&#7789;a or Strongbow, it
does not seem to be the name of any great dynasty. The name very
closely resembles the Gujar√°ti Chor (Prakrit Chau&#7789;√°
or Chora&#7789;√°) meaning thieves or robbers; and
J√°vad√°, which is a further corruption of
Ch√°va&#7693;√°, is the word now in use in those parts for
a thief or robber. Except the mention of the Ch√°vo&#7789;akas in
the Navs√°r&iacute; copperplate we do not find the
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s noticed in any known cotemporary
Gujar√°t copperplates. For this reason it seems fair to regard
them as unimportant rulers over a territory extending from
Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar to A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jaya&#347;ekhara, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696.</span>The author of the
Ratnam√°l√° (<span class="sc">C.</span> 1230 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) says that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 752) Jaya&#347;ekhara the
Ch√°va&#7693;√° king of Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar was
attacked by the Chaulukya king Bhuva&#7693;a of
Kaly√°naka&#7789;aka in Kany√°kubja or Kanoj and slain by
Bhuva&#7693;a in battle. Before his death Jaya&#347;ekhara, finding his
affairs hopeless, sent his pregnant wife Rupasundar&iacute; to the
forest in charge of her brother Surap√°la, one of his chief
warriors. After Jaya&#347;ekhara&rsquo;s death Rupasundar&iacute; gave
birth to a son named Vanar√°ja who became the illustrious founder
of A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. It is hard to say how much truth
underlies this tradition. In the seventh century not Chaulukya but
P√°la kings flourished in Kanoj. No place of importance called
Kaly√°naka&#7789;aka is recorded in the Kanoj territory. And
though there was a southern Ch√°lukya kingdom with its capital at
Kaly√°n, its establishment at Kaly√°n was about the middle
of the eleventh not in the seventh century. Further the known Dakhan
Ch√°lukya lists contain no king named Bhuva&#7693;a, unless he be
the great Ch√°lukya king Vijay√°ditya (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696&ndash;733) also called Bhuvan√°sraya,
who warred in the north and was there imprisoned but made his escape.
The inference is that the author of the Ratnam√°l√°,
knowing the Solan&#775;kis originally belonged to a city called
Kaly√°n, and knowing that a Ch√°lukya king named
Bhuva&#7693;a had defeated the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s may have
called Bhuva&#7693;a king of Kaly√°nka&#7789;aka and identified
Kaly√°nka&#7789;aka with a country so well known to <span class="corr" id="xd25e18262" title="Source: Pur√°nik">Pur√°&#7751;ic</span> fame as
Kany√°kubja. This view is supported by the absence in the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i and other old records of any mention
of an invasion from Kanoj. It is possible that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696 some king Bhuva&#7693;a of the Gujar√°t
<span class="corr" id="xd25e18268" title="Source: Ch√°luky√°s">Ch√°lukyas</span>, of whom at

Ch√°vo&#7789;aka kingdom remain, at least as late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;720, it seems probable that the destruction of
Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar was caused not by Bhuva&#7693;a in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696, but in the Arab raid mentioned above whose

Jaya&#347;ekhara, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696.</span> of the
birth of Vanar√°ja. Merutu&#7751;ga the author of the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i tells how Rupasundar&iacute; was
living in the forest swinging her son in a hammock, when a Jain priest
named &#346;&iacute;lagu&#7751;as&uacute;ri noticing as he passed royal
marks on the boy bought him from his mother. The story adds that a nun
named V&iacute;ramat&iacute; brought up the boy whom the
<i>s√°dhu</i> called Vanar√°ja or the forest king. When
eight years old, the priest employed Vanar√°ja to protect his
place of worship from rats. The boy&rsquo;s skill in shooting rats
convinced the priest he was not fit to be a <i>s√°dhu</i> but was
worthy of a kingdom. He therefore returned the boy to his mother. These
details seem invented by the Jains in their own honour. No mention of
any such story occurs in the Ratnam√°l√°.<a class="noteref"
id="n151.1src" href="#n151.1" name="n151.1src">6</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Vanar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;720&ndash;780 (?).</span>In the forests where
Vanar√°ja passed his youth lived his maternal uncle
Surap√°la, one of Jaya&#347;ekhara&rsquo;s generals, who, after
his sovereign&rsquo;s defeat and death, had become an outlaw.
Vanar√°ja grew up under Surap√°la&rsquo;s charge. The
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i records the following story of the
origin of Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s wealth. A Kany√°kubja king
married Mah√°&#7751;ak√° the daughter of a Gujar√°t
king. To receive the proceeds of the marriage cess which the
Gujar√°t king had levied from his subjects, a deputation or
<i>panchk&uacute;la</i> came from Kany√°kubja to Gujar√°t.
The deputation made Vanar√°ja their leader or <i>sellabhrit</i>
to realize the proceeds of the cess. In six months Vanar√°ja
collected 24 <i>l√°khs</i> of <i>P√°ruttha
drammas</i><a class="noteref" id="n151.2src" href="#n151.2" name="n151.2src">7</a> and 4000 horse, which the deputation took and started
for Kany√°kubja. Vanar√°ja waylaid and killed them, secured
the money and horses, and remained in hiding for a year. With the
wealth thus acquired Vanar√°ja enrolled an army and established
his power assuming the title of king. <span class="marginnote">Founding
of A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;746&ndash;765.</span>He fixed the site of a
capital which afterwards rose to be the great city of
A&#7751;ahilapura. The story of the choice of the site is the usual
story of a hunted hare turning on the hounds showing the place to be
the special nurse of strength and courage. Vanar√°ja is said to
have asked a Bharv√°&#7693; or Shepherd named A&#7751;ahila son
of &#346;√°khad√° to show him the best site. A&#7751;ahila
agreed on condition that the city should be called by his name.
A&#7751;ahila accordingly showed Vanar√°ja the place where a hare
had attacked and chased a dog. Though much in this tradition is
fabulous the city may have been called after some local chief since it
was popularly known as A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a (Sk.
A&#7751;ahilav√°ta) that is the place of A&#7751;ahila. In the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i Merutu&#7751;ga gives <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;746 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 802) as

<span class="corr" id="xd25e18365" title="Source: Vich√°ra&#347;reni">Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i</span>

the date at which according to the Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i he

Merutu&#7751;ga in both his works gives the length of
Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s life at 109 and of his reign at sixty years.
The figure 60 seems to mark the length of his life and not of his
reign. So long a reign as sixty years is barely possible for a
sovereign who succeeded late in life, and the 109 years of his life can
hardly be correct. Taking Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s age at 45 when he was
installed in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;765 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 821) and allowing fifteen years more to
complete the sixty years <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;780
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 836) would be the closing year of
his reign.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s
Installation.</span>The Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i narrates how
generously Vanar√°ja rewarded those who had helped him in his
adversity. His installation was performed by a woman named
&#346;r&iacute; Dev&iacute; of K√°kara village whom in fulfilment
of an early promise Vanar√°ja had taken to be his
sister.<a class="noteref" id="n152.2src" href="#n152.2" name="n152.2src">9</a> The story regarding the promise is that once when
Vanar√°ja had gone with his uncle on a thieving expedition to
K√°kara village and had broken into the house of a merchant he by
mistake dipped his hand into a pot of curds. As to touch curds is the
same as to dine at a house as a guest, Vanar√°ja left the house
without taking anything from it.<a class="noteref" id="n152.3src" href="#n152.3" name="n152.3src">10</a> Hearing what had happened the
merchant&rsquo;s sister invited Vanar√°ja as a brother to dinner
and gave him clothes. In return Vanar√°ja promised if he ever
regained his father&rsquo;s kingdom he should receive his installation
as king at her hands.<a class="noteref" id="n152.4src" href="#n152.4"
name="n152.4src">11</a> Vanar√°ja chose as minister a Bania named
J√°mba. The story is that while Vanar√°ja was looting with
two others he came across a merchant J√°mba who had five arrows.
Seeing only three enemies, J√°mba broke and threw away two of the
arrows, shouting &lsquo;One for each of you.&rsquo; Vanar√°ja
admiring his coolness persuaded J√°mba to join his band and found
him so useful that he promised to make him minister. From the absence
of any reference to him in these and similar tales it is probable that
his uncle Surap√°la died before the installing of
Vanar√°ja. Vanar√°ja is said to have built at
A&#7751;ahilv√°&#7693;a a Jain temple of
Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar√° P√°rasn√°th so called
because the image was brought from the old settlement of
Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar. Mention of this temple continues during the
Solan&#775;ki and V√°ghel√° times.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His Image.</span>Vanar√°ja is said to
have placed a bowing image of himself facing the image of
P√°rasn√°th. The figure of Vanar√°ja is still shown
at Sidhpur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Image of Vanar√°ja.</span> and a woodcut of it is given by the
late Mr. Forbes in his R√°s M√°l√°. It is clearly the
figure of a king with the umbrella of state and a nimbus round the head
and in the ears the long ornaments called <i>kundalas</i> noticed by
Arab travellers as characteristic of the Balhara or <span class="corr"
id="xd25e18493" title="Source: R√°shtrak&uacute;&#7789;a">R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a</span>
kings who were cotemporary with Vanar√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n153.1src" href="#n153.1" name="n153.1src">12</a> The king wears a
long beard, a short waistcloth or <i>dhoti</i>, a waistband or
<i>kammarband</i>, and a shoulder garment or <i>uparna</i> whose ends
hang down the back. Besides the earrings he is adorned with bracelets
armlets and anklets and a large ornament hangs across the chest from
the left shoulder to the right hip. The right hand is held near the
chest in the act of granting protection: and the left hand holds
something which cannot be made out. By his side is the umbrella-bearer
and five other attendants. The statue closely resembles the lifesize
figure of a king of the Solan&#775;ki period lying in the yard of a
temple at M√°li√° about twenty-four miles north of
Soman√°tha Patan. At Soman√°tha Patan are similar but less
rich cotemporary figures of local officers of the Solan&#775;kis.
Another similar figure of which only the torso remains is the statue of
Anr√°ja the father of Vastup√°la in a niche in
Vastup√°la&rsquo;s temple at Girn√°r. The details of this
figure belong to the Solan&#775;ki period.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s Successors,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;780&ndash;961.</span>The lists of
Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s successors vary so greatly in the names, in the
order of succession, and in the lengths of reigns, that little trust
can be placed in them. The first three agree in giving a duration of
196 years to the <span class="corr" id="xd25e18516" title="Source: Ch√°va&#7693;a">Ch√°va&#7693;√°</span>
dynasty after the accession of Vanar√°ja. The accession of the
Solan&#775;ki founder M&uacute;lar√°ja is given in the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i at Sam&#803;vat 1017 and in the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i at Sam&#803;vat 998 corresponding with
the original difference of nineteen years (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 802 and 821) in the founding of the city. This
shows that though the total duration of the dynasty was traditionally
known to be 196 years the order of succession was not known and guesses
were made as to the duration of the different reigns. Certain dates
fixed by inscriptions or otherwise known to some compilers and not
known to others caused many discrepancies in the various accounts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Yogar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;806&ndash;841.</span>According to the
calculations given above Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s reign lasted to about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;780. Authorities agree that
Vanar√°ja was succeeded by his son Yogar√°ja. The length of
Yogar√°ja&rsquo;s reign is given as thirty-five years by the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i and the Ratnam√°l√°, and
as twenty-nine by the Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i. That is according
to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i and Ratnam√°l√° his
reign closes in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;841 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 897) and according to the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;836
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 891). On the whole the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;841 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 897)
seems the more probable. The author of the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i may have mistaken the 7 of the
manuscripts for a 1, the two figures in the manuscripts of that date
being closely alike. If <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;780 is taken
as the close of Vanar√°ja&rsquo;s reign and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;806 as the beginning of Yogar√°ja&rsquo;s
reign an interval of twenty-six years is left. This blank, which
perhaps accounts for the improbably long reign and life assigned to
Vanar√°ja, may have been filled by the forgotten reign of a
childless elder brother of Yogar√°ja. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>

Yogar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;806&ndash;814.</span> Of Yogar√°ja the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i tells the following tale.
Kshemar√°ja one of Yogar√°ja&rsquo;s three sons reported
that several ships were storm-stayed at Prabh√°sa or
Soman√°tha. The ships had 10,000 horses, many elephants, and
millions of money and treasure. Kshemar√°ja prayed that he might
seize the treasure. Yogar√°ja forbad him. In spite of their
father&rsquo;s orders the sons seized the treasure and brought it to
the king. Yogar√°ja said nothing. And when the people asked him
why he was silent he answered: To say I approve would be a sin; to say
I do not approve would annoy you. Hitherto on account of an
ancestor&rsquo;s misdeeds we have been laughed at as a nation of
thieves. Our name was improving and we were rising to the rank of true
kings. This act of my sons has renewed the old stain. Yogar√°ja
would not be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kshemar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;841&ndash;880.</span>According to the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;841 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 898)
Yogar√°ja was succeeded by his son Kshemar√°ja. The
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i says that Yogar√°ja was succeeded
by Ratn√°ditya who reigned three years, and he by
Vairisim&#803;ha who reigned eleven years. Then came Kshemar√°ja
who is mentioned as the son of Yogar√°ja and as coming to the
throne in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;849 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 905). The relationship of Yogar√°ja to
Ratn√°ditya and Vairisim&#803;ha is not given. Probably both were
sons of Yogar√°ja as the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
mentions that Yogar√°ja had three sons. The duration of
Kshemar√°ja&rsquo;s reign is given as thirty-nine years. It is
probable that the reigns of the three brothers lasted altogether for
thirty-nine years, fourteen years for the two elder brothers and
twenty-five years for Kshemar√°ja the period mentioned by the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i. Accepting this chronology
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;880 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 936) will be the date of the close of
Kshemar√°ja&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;880&ndash;908.</span>According to the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i and the Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana
Kshemar√°ja was succeeded by his son Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a.
Instead of Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i mentions Bh&uacute;yada perhaps
another name of Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a, as in the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i the name Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a
does not occur. The Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i notes that
Bh&uacute;yada reigned twenty-nine years and built in
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a Patan the temple of Bh&uacute;yadeshvar.
The <span class="corr" id="xd25e18621" title="Source: Vich√°ra&#347;reni">Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i</span>
gives twenty-seven years as the length of
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s reign an insignificant difference
of two years. This gives <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;908
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 964) as the close of
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s reign according to the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ghagha&#7693;a, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;908&ndash;937.</span>After Bh&uacute;yada the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i places Vairisim&#803;ha and
Ratn√°ditya assigning twenty-five and fifteen years as the reigns
of each. The <span class="corr" id="xd25e18637" title="Source: Vich√°ra&#347;reni">Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i</span>
mentions as the successor of Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a his son
Ghagha&#7693;a who is called R√°ha&#7693;a in the
Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana. Instead of Ghagha&#7693;a the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i gives S√°mantasim&#803;ha or
Lion Chieftain perhaps a title of Gh√°gha&#7693;a&rsquo;s. The
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i gives Ghagha&#7693;a a reign of
twenty-seven years and mentions as his successor an unnamed son who
reigned nineteen years. The Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana gives the
name of this son as Bh&uacute;bha&#7789;a. According to these
calculations the close of Gh√°gha&#7693;a&rsquo;s reign would be
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;936 (Sam&#803;vat 965 + 27 = 992).
Adding nineteen years for Bh&uacute;bha&#7789;a&rsquo;s reign brings
the date of the end of the dynasty to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;956 (Sam&#803;vat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<p>[The period of Ch√°va&#7693;√° rule at
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a is likely to remain obscure until the
discovery of cotemporary inscriptions throws more light upon it than
can be gathered from the confused and contradictory legends collected
by the Solan&#775;ki historians, none of whom are older than the
twelfth century. For the present a few points only can be regarded as
established:</p>
<p>(i) The Ch√°va&#7693;√°s, Ch√°vo&#7789;akas, or
Ch√°potka&#7789;as, are connected with the Ch√°pas of
Bh&iacute;nm√°l and of Vadhv√°n and are therefore of
Gurjjara race. (Compare <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr>
XVII. 192.)</p>
<p>(ii) They probably were never more than feudatories of the
Bh&iacute;nm√°l kings.</p>
<p>(iii) Though the legend places the fall of Pa&ntilde;ch√°sar
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;696 and the foundation of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e18830" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;746, the grant of Pulake&#347;i
Jan√°&#347;raya shows that a Ch√°va&#7693;√°
(Ch√°vo&#7789;aka) kingdom existed in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;728.</p>
<p>As regards the chronology of the dynasty, the explanation of the
long life of 110 years ascribed to Vanar√°ja may be that a
grandson of the same name succeeded the founder of the family. The name
of Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a has, as Dr. B&uuml;hler long ago pointed
out, crept in through some error from the Solan&#775;ki list. But when
the same author in two different works gives such contradictory lists
and dates as Merutu&#7751;ga does in his

next rulers are the Chaulukyas or Solan&#775;kis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;964&ndash;1242) whose conversion to Jainism has
secured them careful record by Jain chroniclers. The earliest writer on
the Solan&#775;kis, the learned Jain priest Hemachandra (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1089&ndash;1173), in his work called the
Dvy√°&#347;raya, has given a fairly full and correct account of
the dynasty up to Siddhar√°ja (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143). The work is said to have been begun by
Hemachandra about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1160, and to have
been finished and revised by another Jain monk named
Abhayatilakaga&#7751;i in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1255.<a class="noteref" id="n156.1src" href="#n156.1" name="n156.1src">1</a> The last chapter which is in Prakrit
deals solely with king Kum√°rap√°la. This work is a grammar
rather than a chronicle, still, though it has little reference to
dates, it is a good collection of tales and descriptions. For
chronology the best guide is the Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i which
its author has taken pains to make the chief authority in dates. The
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i was written by Merutu&#7751;ga about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1314, some time after he wrote the

<p><span class="marginnote">The Name Chaulukya.</span>According to the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i after the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s,
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961 (Vaishakh Suddha 1017), began
the reign of M&uacute;lar√°ja the son of a daughter of the last
Ch√°va&#7693;√° ruler. The name Chaulukya is a Sanskritised
form, through an earlier form Ch√°lukya, of the old names
Chalkya, Chalikya, Chir&icirc;kya, Ch√°lukya of the great Dakhan
dynasty (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;552&ndash;973), made to
harmonise with the <span class="corr" id="xd25e18911" title="Source: Pur√°nik-looking">Pur√°&#7751;ic-looking</span>
story that the founder of the dynasty sprang from the palm or
<i>chuluka</i> of Brahma. The form Chaulukya seems to have been
confined to authors and writers. It was used by the great Dakhan poet
Bilha&#7751;a (c. 1050 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) and by the
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a chroniclers. In Gujar√°t the
popular form of the word seems to have been Solaki or Solan&#775;ki (a
dialectic variant of Chalukya), a name till lately used by
Gujar√°t bards. The sameness of name seems to show the Dakhan and
Gujar√°t dynasties to be branches of one stock. No materials are
available to trace the original seat of the family or to show when and
whence they came to Gujar√°t. The balance of probability is, as
Dr. B&uuml;hler holds, that M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s ancestors
came from the north.<a class="noteref" id="n156.2src" href="#n156.2"

<p><span class="marginnote">M&uacute;lar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;996.</span>The
Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana says that the last
Ch√°va&#7693;√° king Bh&uacute;bha&#7789;a was succeeded by
his sister&rsquo;s son M&uacute;lar√°ja. Of the family or country
of M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s father no details are given. The
<span class="corr" id="xd25e18933" title="Source: Prabandhachintama&#7751;i">Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i</span>
calls M&uacute;lar√°ja the sister&rsquo;s son of
S√°mantasim&#803;ha and gives the following details. In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;930 of the family of Bhuiya&#7693;a
(who destroyed Jaya&#347;ekhara) were three brothers R√°ji, Bija,
and Da&#7751;&#7693;aka, who stopped at A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a
on their way back from a pilgrimage to Soman√°tha in the guise of
K√°rpa&#7789;ika or K√°pdi beggars. The three brothers
attended a cavalry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"

<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
M&uacute;lar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;996.</span> parade held by king
S√°mantasim&#803;ha. An objection taken by R√°ji to some of
the cavalry movements pleased S√°mantasim&#803;ha, who, taking
him to be the scion of some noble family, gave him his sister
L&iacute;l√°dev&iacute; in marriage.
L&iacute;l√°dev&iacute; died pregnant and the child, which was
taken alive from its dead mother&rsquo;s womb was called
M&uacute;lar√°ja, because the operation was performed when the
M&uacute;la constellation was in power. M&uacute;lar√°ja grew
into an able and popular prince and helped to extend the kingdom of his
maternal uncle. In a fit of intoxication S√°mantasim&#803;ha
ordered M&uacute;lar√°ja to be placed on the throne. He
afterwards cancelled the grant. But M&uacute;lar√°ja contended
that a king once installed could not be degraded. He collected troops
defeated and slew his uncle and succeeded to the throne in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;942 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 998).
The main facts of this tale, that M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s father
was one R√°ji of the Ch√°lukya family, that his mother was
a Ch√°va&#7693;√°. princess, and that he came to the
Ch√°va&#7693;√° throne by killing his maternal uncle,
appear to be true. That M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
name was R√°ji is proved by Dr. B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s copperplate
of M&uacute;lar√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n157.1src" href="#n157.1" name="n157.1src">3</a> Merutun&#775;ga&rsquo;s details that
R√°ji came in disguise to A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, took
the fancy of S√°mantasim&#803;ha, and received his sister in
marriage seem fictions in the style common in the bardic praises of
R√°jput princes. Dr. B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s copperplate further
disproves the story as it calls M&uacute;lar√°ja the son of the
illustrious R√°ji, the great king of kings
<i>Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja</i>, a title which would
not be given to a wandering prince. R√°ji appears to have been of
almost equal rank with the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s. The
Ratnam√°l√° calls R√°ji fifth in descent from
Bhuva&#7693;a, his four predecessors being Kar&#7751;√°ditya,
Ch√°ndr√°ditya, Som√°ditya, and Bhuvan√°ditya.
But the Ratnam√°l√° list is on the face of it wrong, as it
gives five instead of seven or eight kings to fill the space of over
200 years between Jaya&#347;ekhara and M&uacute;lar√°ja.</p>
<p>Most Jain chroniclers begin the history of
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a with M&uacute;lar√°ja who with the
Jains is the glory of the dynasty. After taking the small
Ch√°va&#7693;√° kingdom M&uacute;lar√°ja spread his
power in all directions, overrunning
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Kacch on the west, and
fighting B√°rappa of L√°&#7789;a or South Gujar√°t on
the south, and Vigrahar√°ja king of Ajmir on the north. The Ajmir
kings were called Sap√°dalaksha. Why they were so called is not
known. This much is certain that Sap√°dalaksha is the Sanskrit
form of the modern Sew√°lik. It would seem that the
Choh√°ns, whom the Gujar√°t Jain chroniclers call
Sap√°dalaksh&iacute;ya, must have come to Gujar√°t from the
Sew√°lik hills. After leaving the Sew√°lik hills the
capital was at Ajmir, which is usually said to have been first
fortified by the Choh√°n king Ajayap√°la (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1174&ndash;1177).<a class="noteref" id="n157.2src" href="#n157.2" name="n157.2src">4</a> This story seems
invented by the Choh√°ns. The name Ajmir appears to be derived
from the Mehrs who were in power in these parts between the fifth and
the eighth centuries. The Hamm&iacute;ramah√°k√°vya begins
the Choh√°n genealogy with V√°sudeva (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;780) and states that V√°sudeva&rsquo;s
fourth successor <span class="corr" id="xd25e18984" title="Source: &Aacute;jayap√°la">Ajayap√°la</span> established
the hill fort of Ajmir. About this time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;840) the Choh√°ns seem to have made
settlements in the Ajmir country and to have harassed Gujar√°t.

his minister&rsquo;s advice retired to Kanth√°durga apparently
Kanthkot in Cutch.<a class="noteref" id="n158.3src" href="#n158.3"
name="n158.3src">7</a> He remained there till the Navar√°tra or
Nine-Night festival at the close of the rains when he expected the
Sap√°dalaksha king would have to return to Ajmir to worship the
goddess &#346;√°kambhar&iacute; when B√°rappa would be left
alone. At the close of the rains the Sap√°dalaksha king fixed his
camp near a place called &#346;√°kambhar&iacute; and bringing the
goddess &#346;√°kambhar&iacute; there held the Nine-Night
festival. This device disappointed M&uacute;lar√°ja. He sent for
his <i>s√°mantas</i> or nobles and gave them presents. He told
them his plans and called on them to support him in attacking the
Sap√°dalaksha king. M&uacute;lar√°ja then mounted a female
elephant with no attendant but the driver and in the evening came
suddenly to the Ajmir camp. He dismounted and holding a drawn sword in
his hand said to the doorkeeper &lsquo;What is your king doing. Go and
tell your lord that M&uacute;lar√°ja waits at his door.&rsquo;
While the attendant was on his way to give the message,
M&uacute;lar√°ja pushed him on one side and himself went into the
presence. The doorkeeper called &lsquo;Here comes
M&uacute;lar√°ja.&rsquo; Before he could be stopped
M&uacute;lar√°ja forced his way in and took his seat on the
throne. The Ajmir king in consternation asked &lsquo;Are you
M&uacute;lar√°ja?&rsquo; M&uacute;lar√°ja answered &lsquo;I
would regard him as a brave king who would meet me face to face in
battle. While I was thinking no such brave enemy exists, you have
arrived. I ask no better fortune than to fight with you. But as soon as
you are come, like a bee falling in at dinner time, B√°rappa the
general of king Tailapa of Telingana has arrived to attack me. While I
am punishing him you should keep quiet and not give me a side
blow.&rsquo; The Ajmir king said, &lsquo;Though you are a king, you
have come here alone like a foot soldier, not caring for your safety. I
will be your ally for life.&rsquo; M&uacute;lar√°ja replied
&lsquo;Say not so.&rsquo; He refused the R√°ja&rsquo;s invitation
to dine, and leaving sword in hand mounted his elephant and with his
nobles attacked the camp of B√°rappa. B√°rappa was killed
and eighteen of his elephants and 10,000 of his horses fell into
M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s hands. While returning with the spoil
M&uacute;lar√°ja received news that the Sap√°dalaksha king
had fled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>

Chapter II.<br>
<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
M&uacute;lar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;996.</span> This story of the author of
the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i differs from that given by the
author of the Hamm&iacute;rak√°vya who describes
M&uacute;lar√°ja as defeated and slain. The truth seems to be
that the Ajm&iacute;r king defeated M&uacute;lar√°ja and on
M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s submission did not press his advantage.
In these circumstances M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s victory over
B√°rappa seems improbable. The Dvy√°&#347;raya devotes
seventy-five verses (27&ndash;101) of its sixth chapter to the contest
between B√°rappa and M&uacute;lar√°ja. The details may be
thus summarised. Once when M&uacute;lar√°ja received presents
from various Indian kings Dv√°rappa<a class="noteref" id="n159.1src" href="#n159.1" name="n159.1src">8</a> king of
L√°&#7789;ade&#347;a sent an ill-omened elephant. The marks being
examined by royal officers and by prince Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a,
they decided the elephant would bring destruction on the king who kept
him. The elephant was sent back in disgrace and M&uacute;lar√°ja
and his son started with an army to attack L√°&#7789;ade&#347;a
and avenge the insult. In his march M&uacute;lar√°ja first came
to the &#346;vabhravat&iacute; or S√°barmat&iacute; which formed
the boundary of his kingdom, frightening the people. From the
S√°barmat&iacute; he advanced to the ancient Pur&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="n159.2src" href="#n159.2" name="n159.2src">9</a> where
also the people became confused. The L√°&#7789;a king prepared
for fight, and was slain by <span class="corr" id="xd25e19075" title="Source: Ch√°mun&#7693;a">Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a</span> in
single combat. M&uacute;lar√°ja advanced to Broach where
B√°rappa who was assisted by the island kings opposed him.
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a overcame them and slew B√°rappa.
After this success M&uacute;lar√°ja and
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a returned to A&#7751;ahilapura.<a class="noteref" id="n159.3src" href="#n159.3" name="n159.3src">10</a></p>
<p>The Dvy√°&#347;raya styles B√°rappa king of
L√°&#7789;ade&#347;a; the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i calls
him a general of Tailapa king of Teling√°na; the
Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana a general of the Kany√°kubja king;
and the K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="n159.4src"
href="#n159.4" name="n159.4src">11</a> a general of the Lord of
L√°&#7789;a.</p>
<p>Other evidence proves that at the time of M&uacute;lar√°ja a
Chaulukya king named B√°rappa did reign in
L√°&#7789;ade&#347;a. The Surat grant of K&iacute;rtir√°ja
grandson of B√°rappa is dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1018 (&#346;aka 940). This, taking twenty years
to a king, brings B√°rappa&rsquo;s date to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;978 (&#346;aka 900), a year which falls in the
reign of M&uacute;lar√°ja (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;996; &#346;. 1027&ndash;1053). The
statement in the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i that B√°rappa
was a general of Tailapa seems correct. The southern form of the name
B√°rappa supports the statement. And as Tailapa overthrew the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;972 (&#346;aka 894) he might well place a general
in military charge of L√°&#7789;a, and allow him practical
independence. This would explain why the Dvy√°&#347;raya calls
B√°rappa king of L√°&#7789;ade&#347;a and why the
K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; calls him general of the Lord of
L√°&#7789;a.</p>
<p>One of M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s earliest wars was with
Graharipu the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra or <span class="corr" id="xd25e19105" title="Source: Chu&#7693;√°sam√°">Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°</span>

M&uacute;lar√°ja, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;996.</span> of war was
Graharipu&rsquo;s oppression of pilgrims to Prabh√°sa.
Graharipu&rsquo;s capital was V√°manasthal&iacute;, the modern
Vanthal&iacute; nine miles west of Jun√°ga&#7693;h, and the fort
of Durgapalli which Graharipu is said to have established must be
Jun√°ga&#7693;h itself which was not then a capital. Graharipu is
described as a cow-eating Mlechha and a grievous tyrant. He is said to
have had much influence over L√°kh√° son of king Phula of
Kacch and to have been helped by Turks and other Mlechhas. When
M&uacute;lar√°ja reached the Jambum√°li river, he was met
by Graharipu and his army. With Graharipu was L√°kh√° of
Kacch, the king of Sindh probably a Sumr√°, Mew√°s Bhilas,
and the sons of Graharipu&rsquo;s wife N&iacute;l&iacute; who had been
summoned from near the Bhadar river by a message in the Yavana
language.<a class="noteref" id="n160.1src" href="#n160.1" name="n160.1src">13</a> With M&uacute;lar√°ja were the kings of
&#346;il√°prastha,<a class="noteref" id="n160.2src" href="#n160.2" name="n160.2src">14</a> of M√°rw√°r, of
K√°s&iacute;, of Arbuda or Abu, and of &#346;r&iacute;m√°la
or Bh&iacute;nm√°l. M&uacute;lar√°ja had also his own
younger brother Gang√°mah, his friend king Revat&iacute;mitra,
and Bhils. It is specially mentioned that in this expedition
M&uacute;lar√°ja received no help from the sons of his paternal
uncles B&iacute;ja and Dandaka. The fight ended in Graharipu being made
prisoner by M&uacute;lar√°ja, and in L√°kh√° being
slain with a spear. After the victory M&uacute;lar√°ja went to
Prabh√°sa, worshipped the <i>lin&#775;ga</i>, and returned to
<span class="corr" id="xd25e19146" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
with his army and 108 elephants.</p>
<p>According to the author of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
L√°kh√° met his death in a different contest with
M&uacute;lar√°ja. L√°kh√° who is described as the son
of Phulad√°, and K√°malat√° daughter of
K&iacute;rttir√°ja a Parm√°r king, is said to have been
invincible because he was under the protection of king Ya&#347;ovarman
of M√°lwa. He defeated M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s army eleven
times. In a twelfth encounter M&uacute;lar√°ja besieged
L√°kh√° in Kapilakot, slew him in single combat, and trod
on his flowing beard. Enraged at this insult to her dead son
L√°kh√°&rsquo;s mother called down on
M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s descendants the curse of the spider
poison that is of leprosy.<a class="noteref" id="n160.3src" href="#n160.3" name="n160.3src">15</a></p>
<p>Mr. Forbes, apparently from bardic sources, states that on his
wife&rsquo;s death R√°ji the father of M&uacute;lar√°ja
went to the temple of <span class="corr" id="xd25e19157" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span> at Dw√°rk√°. On his
return he visited the court of L√°kh√° Phul√°ni and
espoused L√°kh√°&rsquo;s sister R√°y√°ji by
whom he had a son named R√°kh√°ich. This marriage proved
the ruin of R√°ji. In a dispute about precedence
L√°kh√° slew R√°ji and many of his R√°jput
followers, his wife R√°y√°ji becoming a Sat&iacute;.
B&iacute;ja the uncle of M&uacute;lar√°ja urged his nephew to
avenge his father&rsquo;s death and M&uacute;lar√°ja was further
incited against L√°kh√° because L√°kh√°
harboured R√°kh√°ich the younger son of R√°ji at his
court as a rival to M&uacute;lar√°ja.</p>
<p>According to the Dvy√°&#347;raya, either from the rising power
of his son or from repentance for his own rough acts, after
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s victory over B√°rappa
M&uacute;lar√°ja installed him as ruler and devoted himself to
religion and charity. According to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
M&uacute;lar√°ja built in A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a a Jain
temple named M&uacute;lavasatik√°. But as the Nandi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>

temple of Mah√°deva called Tripurushapr√°s√°da on a
site to which the tradition attaches that seeing M&uacute;lar√°ja
daily visiting the temple of M&uacute;lan√°thadeva at
Ma&#7751;&#7693;ali, <span class="corr" id="xd25e19193" title="Source: Somanatha">Soman√°tha</span> Mah√°deva being
greatly pleased promised to bring the ocean to
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. Soman√°tha came, and the ocean
accompanying the god certain ponds became brackish. In honour of these
salt pools M&uacute;lar√°ja built the
Tripurushapr√°s√°da. Looking for some one to place in
charge of this temple, M&uacute;lar√°ja heard of an ascetic named
Ka&#7751;thadi at Siddhapura on the banks of the Sarasvat&iacute; who
used to fast every other day and on the intervening day lived on five
morsels of food. M&uacute;lar√°ja offered this sage the charge of
the temple. The sage declined saying &lsquo;Authority is the surest
path to hell.&rsquo; Eventually Vayajalladeva a disciple of the sage
undertook the management on certain conditions. M&uacute;lar√°ja
passed most of his days at the holy shrine of Siddhapura, the modern
Sidhpur on the Sarasvat&iacute; about fifteen miles north-east of
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. At Sidhpur M&uacute;lar√°ja made
many grants to Br√°hmans. Several branches of Gujar√°t
Br√°hmans, Aud&iacute;chyas &#346;r&iacute;gau&#7693;as and
Kanojias, trace their origin in Gujar√°t to an invitation from
M&uacute;lar√°ja to Siddhapura and the local <span class="corr"
id="xd25e19197" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span> and
M√°h√°tmyas confirm the story. As the term Aud&iacute;chya
means Northerner M&uacute;lar√°ja may have invited
Br√°hmans from some such holy place as Kurukshetra which the
Aud&iacute;chyas claim as their home. From Kany√°kubja in the
Madhyade&#347;a between the Ganges and the Yamun√° another
equally holy place the Kanoj&iacute;as may have been invited. The
&#346;r&iacute; Gau&#7693;as appear to have come from Bengal and
Tirhut. Gau&#7693;a and Tirhut Br√°hmans are noted
T√°ntriks and Mantras√°stris a branch of learning for which
both the people and the rulers of Gujar√°t have a great fondness.
Grants of villages were made to these Br√°hmans. Sidhpur was
given to the Aud&iacute;chyas, Sim&#803;hapura or Sihor in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a to some other colony, and
Stambhat&iacute;rtha or Cambay to the &#346;r&iacute; Gau&#7693;as. At
Siddhapura M&uacute;lar√°ja built the famous temple called the
Rudramah√°laya or the great shrine of Rudra. According to
tradition M&uacute;lar√°ja did not complete the
Rudramah√°laya and Siddhar√°ja finished it. In spite of
this tradition it does not appear that M&uacute;lar√°ja died
leaving the great temple unfinished as a copperplate of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;987 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1043)

is available. The author of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
assigns him a reign of thirteen years. The author of the
Dvy√°&#347;raya says that he had three sons Vallabha R√°ja,
Durlabha R√°ja, and N√°ga R√°ja. According to one
account Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a installed Vallabha in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1010 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1066)
and went on pilgrimage to Benares. On his passage through M√°lwa
Mu&ntilde;ja the M√°lwa king carried off
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s umbrella and other marks of
royalty.<a class="noteref" id="n162.2src" href="#n162.2" name="n162.2src">19</a> Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a went on to Benares in
the guise of a hermit. On his return he prayed his son to avenge the
insult offered by the king of M√°lwa. Vallabha started with an
army but died of small-pox. The author of the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i gives Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a a
reign of six months, while the author of the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i entirely drops his name and gives a
reign of fourteen years to Vallabha made up of the thirteen years of
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a and the six months of Vallabha. This seems
to be a mistake. It would seem more correct, as is done in several
copperplate lists, to omit Vallabha, since he must have reigned jointly
with his father and his name is not wanted for purposes of succession.
The Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i and the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i agree in ending Vallabha&rsquo;s reign
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1010 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1066). The author of the Dvy√°&#347;raya
states that Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a greatly lamenting the death of
Vallabha installed Vallabha&rsquo;s younger brother Durlabha, and
himself retired to die at &#346;uklat&iacute;rtha on the

R√°ja of Nadol in M√°rw√°r. The kings of An&#775;ga,
K√°s&iacute;, Avant&iacute;, Ched&iacute;, Kuru,
H&uacute;&#7751;a, Mathur√°, Vindhya, and Andhra were also
present.<a class="noteref" id="n163.1src" href="#n163.1" name="n163.1src">20</a> The princess chose Durlabha and Mahendra gave his
younger sister Lakshm&iacute; to Durlabha&rsquo;s brother N√°ga
R√°ja. The princess&rsquo; choice of Durlabha drew on him the
enmity of certain of the other kings all of whom he defeated. The
brothers then returned to A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a where Durlabha
built a lake called Durlabhasarovara. The author of the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i says that Durlabha gave up the kingdom
to his son (?) Bh&iacute;ma.<a class="noteref" id="n163.2src" href="#n163.2" name="n163.2src">21</a> He also states that Durlabha went on
pilgrimage and was insulted on the way by Mu&ntilde;ja king of
M√°lwa. This seems the same tale which the Dvy√°&#347;raya
tells of Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a. Since Mu&ntilde;ja cannot have
been a cotemporary of Durlabha the Dvy√°&#347;raya&rsquo;s
account seems correct.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Bh&iacute;ma I. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1022&ndash;1064.</span>Durlabha was succeeded by
his nephew Bh&iacute;ma the son of Durlabha&rsquo;s younger brother
N√°ga R√°ja. The author of the Dvy√°&#347;raya says
that Durlabha wishing to retire from the world offered the kingdom to
his nephew Bh&iacute;ma; that Bh&iacute;ma declined in favour of his
father N√°ga R√°ja; that N√°ga R√°ja refused;
that Durlabha and N√°ga R√°ja persuaded Bh&iacute;ma to
take the government; and that after installing Bh&iacute;ma the two
brothers died together. Such a voluntary double death sounds unlikely
unless the result was due to the machinations of Bh&iacute;ma. The
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i gives Bh&iacute;ma a reign of
fifty-two years from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1022 to 1074
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1078&ndash;1130), while the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i reduces his reign to forty-two years
placing its close in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1064
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1120). Forty-two years would seem
to be correct as another copy of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
has 42.</p>
<p>Two copperplates of Bh&iacute;ma are available one dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1030 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1086) eight or nine years after he came to the
throne, the other from Kacch in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1037
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1093).</p>
<p>Bh&iacute;ma seems to have been more powerful than either of his
predecessors. According to the Dvy√°&#347;raya his two chief
enemies were the kings of Sindh and of Ched&iacute; or Bundelkhand. He
led a victorious expedition against Hammuka the king of Sindh, who had
conquered the king of Sivas√°na and another against Kar&#7751;a
king of Ched&iacute; who paid tribute and submitted. The
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i has a verse, apparently an old verse
interpolated, which says that on the M√°lwa king Bhoja&rsquo;s
death, while sacking Dh√°r√°puri, Kar&#7751;a took
Bh&iacute;ma as his coadjutor, and that afterwards Bh&iacute;ma&rsquo;s
general D√°mara took Kar&#7751;a captive and won from him a gold
<i>ma&#7751;&#7693;apik√°</i> or canopy and images of Gane&#347;a
and N&iacute;laka&#7751;&#7789;he&#347;vara Mah√°deva.
Bh&iacute;ma is said to have presented the canopy to
Soman√°tha.</p>
<p>When Bh&iacute;ma was engaged against the king of Sindh, Kulachandra
the general of the M√°lwa king Bhoja with all the M√°lwa
feudatories, invaded A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, sacked the city,
and sowed shell-money at the gate where the time-marking gong was
sounded. So great was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

&lsquo;sacking of Kulachandra&rsquo; has passed into a proverb.
Kulachandra also took from A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a an
acknowledgment of victory or <i>jayapatra</i>. On his return Bhoja
received Kulachandra with honour but blamed him for not sowing salt
instead of shell-money.<a class="noteref" id="n164.1src" href="#n164.1"
name="n164.1src">22</a> He said the shell-money is an omen that the
wealth of M√°lwa will flow to Gujar√°t. An unpublished
inscription of Bhoja&rsquo;s successor Uday√°ditya in a temple at
Udepur near Bhils√° confirms the above stating that Bh&iacute;ma
was conquered by Bhoja&rsquo;s officers.<a class="noteref" id="n164.2src" href="#n164.2" name="n164.2src">23</a></p>
<p>The Solan&#775;ki kings of A&#7751;ahilapura being &#346;aivites
held the god Soman√°tha of Prabh√°sa in great veneration.
The very ancient and holy shrine of Prabh√°sa has long been a
place of special pilgrimage. As early as the Y√°davas of
Dw√°rk√°,<a class="noteref" id="n164.3src" href="#n164.3"
name="n164.3src">24</a> pilgrimages to Prabh√°sa are recorded but
the Mah√°bh√°rata makes no mention either of
Soman√°tha or of any other &#346;aivite shrine. The shrine of
Soman√°tha was probably not established before the time of the
Valabhis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;480&ndash;767). As the
Valabhi kings were most open-handed in religious gifts, it was probably
through their grants that the Soman√°tha temple rose to
importance. The Solan&#775;kis were not behind the Valabhis in devotion
to Soman√°tha. To save pilgrims from oppression
M&uacute;lar√°ja fought Graharipu the &Aacute;bh&iacute;ra king
of Sorath.<a class="noteref" id="n164.4src" href="#n164.4" name="n164.4src">25</a> M&uacute;lar√°ja afterwards went to
Prabh√°sa and also built temples in Gujar√°t in honour of
the god Soman√°tha. As M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s successors
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a and Durlabha continued firm devotees of
Soman√°tha during their reigns (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;997&ndash;1022) the wealth of the temple must
have greatly increased.</p>

<p>Of the destruction of Soman√°tha the earliest Musalm√°n
account, of Ibn As&iacute;r (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1160&ndash;1229), supplies the following details:
In the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1024 (H. 414)
Mahm&uacute;d captured several forts and cities in Hind and he also
took the idol called Soman√°tha. This idol was the greatest of
all the idols of Hind. At every eclipse<a class="noteref" id="n165.2src" href="#n165.2" name="n165.2src">28</a> the Hindus went on
pilgrimage to the temple, and there congregated to the number of a
hundred thousand persons. According to their doctrine of transmigration
the Hindus believe that after separation from the body the souls of men
meet at Soman√°tha; and that the ebb and flow of the tide is the
worship paid to the best of its power by the sea to the idol.<a class="noteref" id="n165.3src" href="#n165.3" name="n165.3src">29</a> All
that is most precious in India was brought to Soman√°tha. The
temple attendants received the most valuable presents, and the temple
was endowed with more than 10,000 villages.<a class="noteref" id="n165.4src" href="#n165.4" name="n165.4src">30</a> In the temple were
amassed jewels of the most exquisite quality and of incalculable value.
The people of India have a great river called Ganga to which they pay
the highest honour and into which they cast the bones of their great
men, in the belief that the deceased will thus secure an entrance to
heaven. Though between this river and Soman√°tha is a distance of
about 1200 miles (200 <i>parasangs</i>) water was daily brought from it
to wash the idol.<a class="noteref" id="n165.5src" href="#n165.5" name="n165.5src">31</a> Every day a thousand Br√°hmans performed the
worship and introduced visitors.<a class="noteref" id="n165.6src" href="#n165.6" name="n165.6src">32</a> The shaving of the heads and beards
of pilgrims employed three hundred barbers.<a class="noteref" id="n165.7src" href="#n165.7" name="n165.7src">33</a> Three hundred and
fifty persons sang and danced at the gate of the temple,<a class="noteref" id="n165.8src" href="#n165.8" name="n165.8src">34</a> every
one receiving a settled daily allowance. When Mahm&uacute;d was gaining
victories and demolishing idols in North India, the Hindus said
Soman√°tha is displeased with these idols. If Soman√°tha
had been satisfied with them no one could have destroyed or injured
them. When Mahm&uacute;d heard this he resolved on making a campaign to
destroy Soman√°tha, believing that when the Hindus saw their
prayers and imprecations to be false and futile they would embrace the
Faith.</p>
<p>So he prayed to the Almighty for aid, and with 30,000 horse besides
volunteers left Ghazni on the 10th Sha&rsquo;b√°n (H. 414,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1024). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Soman√°tha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1024.</span> He
took the road to Mult√°n and reached it in the middle of
Ramz√°n. The road from Mult√°n to India lay through a
barren desert without inhabitants or food. Mahm&uacute;d collected
provisions for the passage and loading 30,000 camels with water and
corn started for A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. After he had crossed
the desert he perceived on one side a fort full of people in which
place there were wells.<a class="noteref" id="n166.1src" href="#n166.1"
name="n166.1src">35</a> The leaders came to conciliate him, but he
invested the place, and God gave him victory over it, for the hearts of
the people failed them through fear. He brought the place under the
sway of Isl√°m, killed the inhabitants, and broke in pieces their
images. His men carrying water with them marched for
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, where they arrived at the beginning of
Z&iacute;lk√°da.</p>
<p>The Chief of A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, called Bh&iacute;m,
fled hastily, and abandoning his city went to a certain fort for safety
and to prepare for war. Mahm&uacute;d pushed on for Soman√°tha.
On his march he came to several forts in which were many images serving
as chamberlains or heralds of Soman√°tha. These Mahm&uacute;d
called Shait√°n or devils. He killed the people, destroyed the
fortifications, broke the idols in pieces, and through a waterless
desert marched to Soman√°tha. In the desert land he met 20,000
fighting men whose chiefs would not submit. He sent troops against
them, defeated them, put them to flight, and plundered their
possessions. From the desert he marched to Dabalw√°rah,<a class="noteref" id="n166.2src" href="#n166.2" name="n166.2src">36</a> two
days&rsquo; journey from Soman√°tha. The people of
Dabalw√°rah stayed in the city believing that the word of
Soman√°tha would drive back the invaders. Mahm&uacute;d took the
place, slew the men, plundered their property, and marched to
Soman√°tha.</p>
<p>Reaching Soman√°tha on a Thursday in the middle of
Z&iacute;lk√°da Mahm&uacute;d beheld a strong fortress built on
the sea-shore, so that its walls were washed by the waves.<a class="noteref" id="n166.3src" href="#n166.3" name="n166.3src">37</a> From
the walls the people jeered at the Musalm√°ns. Our deity, they
said, will cut off the last man of you and destroy you all. On the
morrow which was Friday the assailants advanced to the assault. When
the Hindus saw how the Muhammadans fought they abandoned their posts
and left the walls. The Musalm√°ns planted their ladders and
scaled the walls. From the top they raised their war-cry, and showed
the might of Isl√°m. Still their loss was so heavy that the issue
seemed doubtful. A body of Hindus hurried to Soman√°tha, cast
themselves on the ground before him, and besought him to grant them
victory. Night came on and the fight was stayed.</p>
<p>Early next morning Mahm&uacute;d renewed the battle. His men made
greater havoc among the Hindus till they drove them from the town to
the house of their idol Soman√°tha. At the gate of the temple the
slaughter was dreadful. Band after band of the defenders entered the
temple and standing before Soman√°tha with their hands clasped
round their necks wept and passionately entreated him. Then they issued
forth to fight and fought till they were slain. The few left alive took

Soman√°tha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1024.</span> to the
sea in boats but the Musalm√°ns overtook them and some were
killed and some were drowned.</p>
<p>The temple of Soman√°tha rested on fifty-six pillars of
teakwood covered with lead.<a class="noteref" id="n167.1src" href="#n167.1" name="n167.1src">38</a> The idol was in a dark chamber. The
height of the idol was five cubits and its girth three cubits. This was
what appeared to the eye; two cubits were hidden in the basement. It
had no appearance of being sculptured. Mahm&uacute;d seized it, part of
it he burnt, and part he carried with him to Ghazni, where he made it a
step at the entrance of the Great Mosque.<a class="noteref" id="n167.2src" href="#n167.2" name="n167.2src">39</a> The dark shrine was
lighted by exquisitely jewelled chandeliers. Near the idol was a chain
of gold 200 <i>mans</i> in weight. To the chain bells were fastened.
And when each watch of the night was over the chain was shaken and the
ringing of the bells roused a fresh party of Br√°hmans to carry
on the worship. In the treasury which was near the shrine were many
idols of gold and silver. Among the treasures were veils set with
jewels, every jewel of immense value. What was found in the temple was
worth more than two millions of <i>din√°rs</i>. Over fifty
thousand Hindus were slain.<a class="noteref" id="n167.3src" href="#n167.3" name="n167.3src">40</a></p>
<p>After the capture of Soman√°tha, Mahm&uacute;d received
intelligence that Bh&iacute;m the chief of
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a had gone to the fort of
Khandahat,<a class="noteref" id="n167.4src" href="#n167.4" name="n167.4src">41</a> about 240 miles (40 <i>parasangs</i>) from
Soman√°tha between that place and the desert. Mahm&uacute;d
marched to Khandahat. When he came before it he questioned some men who
were hunting as to the tide. He learned that the ford was practicable,
but that if the wind blew a little the crossing was dangerous.
Mahm&uacute;d prayed to the Almighty and entered the water. He and his
forces passed safely and drove out the enemy. From Khandahat he
returned intending to proceed against Mans&uacute;ra in central Sindh,
whose ruler was an apostate Muhammadan. At the news of
Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s approach the chief fled into the date forests.
Mahm&uacute;d followed, and surrounding him and his adherents, many of
them were slain, many drowned, and few escaped. Mahm&uacute;d then went

Soman√°tha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1024.</span> to
Bh√°ti√°, and after reducing the inhabitants to obedience,
returned to Ghazni where he arrived on the 10th Safar 417 H.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1026).</p>
<p>The Rauzatu-s-saf√° of Mirkhand supplements these details with
the following account of Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s arrangements for holding
Gujar√°t: &lsquo;It is related that when <span class="corr" id="xd25e19645" title="Source: Sultan">Sult√°n</span> Mahm&uacute;d
had achieved the conquest of Soman√°tha he wished to fix his
residence there for some years because the country was very extensive
and possessed many advantages among them several mines which produced
pure gold. Indian rubies were brought from Sarand&iacute;p, one of the
dependencies of the kingdom of Gujar√°t. His ministers
represented to Mahm&uacute;d that to forsake Khur√°s√°n
which had been won from his enemies after so many battles and to make
Soman√°tha the seat of government was very improper. At last the
king made up his mind to return and ordered some one to be appointed to
hold and carry on the administration of the country. The ministers
observed that as it was impossible for a stranger to maintain
possession he should assign the country to one of the native chiefs.
The Sult√°n accordingly held a council to settle the nomination,
in concurrence with such of the inhabitants as were well disposed
towards him. Some of them represented to him that amongst the ancient
royal families no house was so noble as that of the
D√°bshil&iacute;ms of whom only one member survived, and he had
assumed the habit of a Br√°hman, and was devoted to philosophical
pursuits and austerity.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n168.1src" href="#n168.1" name="n168.1src">42</a></p>
<p>That Mahm&uacute;d should have found it necessary to appoint some
local chief to keep order in Gujar√°t is probable. It is also
probable that he would choose some one hostile to the defeated king. It
has been suggested above that Bh&iacute;ma&rsquo;s uncle Durlabha did
not retire but was ousted by his nephew and that the story of Vallabha
and Durlabha dying together pointed to some usurpation on the part of
Bh&iacute;ma. The phrase the D√°bshil&iacute;ms seems to refer
either to Durlabhasena or his son. Whoever was chosen must have lost
his power soon after Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s departure.<a class="noteref"

<p>A few years later Bh&iacute;ma was on bad terms with Dhandhuka the
Param√°ra chief of &Aacute;bu, and sent his general Vimala to
subdue him. Dhandhuka submitted and made over to Vimala the beautiful
Chitrak&ucirc;&#7789;a peak of &Aacute;bu, where, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1032 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1088),

<p>Bh&iacute;ma had three wives Uday√°mat&iacute; who built a
step-well at A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, Bukul√°dev&iacute;,
and another. These ladies were the mothers of Kar&#7751;a,
Kshemar√°ja, and M&uacute;lar√°ja. Of the three sons
M&uacute;lar√°ja, though his mother&rsquo;s name is unknown, was
the eldest and the heir-apparent. Of the kindly M&uacute;lar√°ja
the author of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i tells the following
tale: In a year of scarcity the Ku&#7789;umbikas or cultivators of
Vishopaka and Da&#7751;&#7693;√°hi found themselves unable to pay
the king his share of the land-produce. Bh&iacute;mar√°ja sent a
minister to inquire and the minister brought before the king all the
well-to-do people of the defaulting villages. One day prince
M&uacute;lar√°ja saw these men talking to one another in alarm.
Taking pity on them he pleased the king by his skilful riding. The king
asked him to name a boon and the prince begged that the demand on the
villagers might be remitted. The boon was granted, the ryots went home
in glee, but within three days M&uacute;lar√°ja was dead. Next
season yielded a bumper harvest, and the people came to present the
king with his share for that year as well as with the remitted share
for the previous year. Bh&iacute;mdev declined to receive the arrears.
A jury appointed by the king settled that the royal share of the
produce for both years should be placed in the king&rsquo;s hands for
the erection of a temple called the new Tripurushapr√°s√°da
for the spiritual welfare of prince M&uacute;lar√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n169.2src" href="#n169.2" name="n169.2src">45</a>

Bh&iacute;ma I. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1022&ndash;1064.</span> Bh&iacute;ma reigned
forty-two years. Both the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i and the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i mention Kar&#7751;a as his successor.
According to the Dvy√°&#347;raya Bh&iacute;ma, wishing to retire
to a religious life, offered the succession to Kshemar√°ja. But
Kshemar√°ja also was averse from the labour of ruling and it was
settled that Kar&#7751;a should succeed.</p>
<p>Bh&iacute;ma died soon after and Kshemar√°ja retired to a holy
place on the Sarasvat&iacute; named Mundake&#347;vara not far from
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. Kar&#7751;a is said to have granted
Dahithal&iacute; a neighbouring village to <span class="corr" id="xd25e19763" title="Source: Devapr√°s√°da">Devapras√°da</span> the son
of Kshemar√°ja that he might attend on his father in his
religious seclusion. But as the Kum√°rap√°lacharita
mentions Kshemar√°ja being settled at Dahithal&iacute; as a ruler
not as an ascetic it seems probable that Dahithal&iacute; was granted
to Kshemar√°ja for maintenance as villages are still granted to
the <i>bh√°y√°s</i> or brethren of the ruler.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kar&#7751;a, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1064&ndash;1094.</span>Kar&#7751;a who came to
the throne in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1064 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1120) had a more peaceful reign than his
predecessors. He was able to build charitable public works among them a
temple called Kar&#7751;a-meru at A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. His
only war was an expedition against &Aacute;sh√° Bhil, chief of

Kochharva,<a class="noteref" id="n170.3src" href="#n170.3" name="n170.3src">48</a> Kar&#7751;a built her a temple in As√°val and
also built temples to Jayant&iacute; Dev&iacute; and
Kar&#7751;e&#347;vara Mah√°deva. He made a lake called
Kar&#7751;as√°gara and founded a city called
Kar&#7751;√°vat&iacute; which he made his capital.</p>
<p>Kar&#7751;a had three ministers <span class="corr" id="xd25e19796"
title="Source: Munj√°la">Mu&ntilde;j√°la</span>,
S√°ntu, and Udaya. Udaya was a &#346;r&iacute;m√°l&iacute;
V√°ni√° of M√°rw√°r, who had settled in
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a and who was originally called
Ud√°. S√°ntu built a Jain temple called S√°ntu-vasahi
and Ud√° built at Kar&#7751;√°vat&iacute; a large temple
called Udaya-var√°ha, containing seventy-two images of
Tirthankars, twenty-four past twenty-four present and twenty-four to
come. By different wives Ud√° had five sons, &Aacute;ha&#7693;a
or Astha&#7693;a, Ch√°ha&#7693;a, B√°ha&#7693;a,
&Aacute;mbada, and Soll√°, of whom the last three were half
brothers of the first two.<a class="noteref" id="n170.4src" href="#n170.4" name="n170.4src">49</a> Except Soll√°, who continued a
merchant and became very wealthy, all the sons entered the service of
the state and rose to high stations during the reign of
Kum√°rap√°la.</p>
<p>In late life Kar&#7751;a married Miy√°&#7751;alladev&iacute;
daughter of Jayake&#347;i son of &#346;ubhake&#347;i king of the
Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;aka. According to the Dvy√°&#347;raya a

marry Kar&#7751;a. In token of her wish to marry Kar&#7751;a the
painter said the princess had sent Kar&#7751;a an elephant. Kar&#7751;a
went to see the present and found on the elephant a beautiful princess
who had come so far in the hope of winning him for a husband. According
to the <span class="corr" id="xd25e19837" title="Source: Prabandhachintama&#7751;i">Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i</span>
Kar&#7751;a found the princess ugly and refused to marry her. On this
the princess with eight attendants determined to burn themselves on a
funeral pyre and Uday√°mat&iacute; Kar&#7751;a&rsquo;s mother
also declared that if he did not relent she too would be a sacrifice.
Under this compulsion Kar&#7751;a married the princess but refused to
treat her as a wife. The minister <span class="corr" id="xd25e19840"
title="Source: Mu&ntilde;jala">Mu&ntilde;j√°la</span>, learning
from a <i>ka&ntilde;chuk&iacute;</i> or palace-servant that the king
loved a certain courtezan, contrived that Miy√°nalladev&iacute;
should take the woman&rsquo;s place, a device still practised by
ministers of native states. Kar&#7751;a fell into the snare and the
queen became pregnant by him, having secured from the hand of her
husband his signet ring as a token which could not be disclaimed. Thus
in Kar&#7751;a&rsquo;s old age Miy√°nalladev&iacute; became the
mother of the illustrious Siddhar√°ja Jayasim&#803;ha, who,
according to a local tradition quoted by Mr. Forbes, first saw the
light at P√°lanpur.<a class="noteref" id="n171.2src" href="#n171.2" name="n171.2src">52</a> When three years old the precocious
Siddhar√°ja climbed and sat upon the throne. This ominous event
being brought to the king&rsquo;s notice he consulted his astrologers
who advised that from that day Siddhar√°ja should be installed as
heir-apparent.</p>
<p>The Gujar√°t chronicles do not record how or when Kar&#7751;a
died. It appears from a manuscript that he was reigning in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1089 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr>

D√°d√°ka was then minister of Siddhar√°ja. Among his
generals the best known was a chief named Jagaddeva (Jag Dev), commonly
believed to be a Param√°ra, many of whose feats of daring are
recorded in bardic and popular romances.<a class="noteref" id="n172.2src" href="#n172.2" name="n172.2src">57</a> Though Jag Dev is
generally called a Param√°ra nothing of his family is on record.
The author of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i describes Jagaddeva
as a thrice valiant warrior held in great respect by Siddhar√°ja.
After Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s death Jagaddeva went to serve king
Perm√°di to whose mother&rsquo;s family he was related.<a class="noteref" id="n172.3src" href="#n172.3" name="n172.3src">58</a>
Perm√°di gave him a chiefship and sent him to attack
M√°lava.</p>
<p>When Siddhar√°ja attained manhood his mother prepared to go in
great state on pilgrimage to Soman√°tha. She went with rich
offerings as far as B√°hulo&#7693;a apparently the large modern
village of Bhol√°da on the
Gujar√°t-K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a frontier about
twenty-two miles south-west of Dholk√°. At this frontier town the
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a kings levied a tax on all pilgrims to
Soman√°tha. Many of the pilgrims unable to pay the tax had to
return home in tears. Miy√°nalladev&iacute; was so saddened by
the woes of the pilgrims that she stopped her pilgrimage and returned
home. Siddhar√°ja met her on the way and asked her why she had
turned back. Miy√°nalladev&iacute; said, I will neither eat nor
go to Soman√°tha until you order the remission of the pilgrim
tax. Siddhar√°ja called the Bhol√°da treasurer and found
that the levy yielded 72 l√°khs a year.<a class="noteref" id="n172.4src" href="#n172.4" name="n172.4src">59</a> In spite of the
serious sacrifice Siddhar√°ja broke the board authorizing the
levy of the tax and pouring water from his hand into his mother&rsquo;s
declared that the merit of the remission was hers. The queen went to
Soman√°tha and worshipped the god with gold presenting an
elephant and other gifts and handing over her own weight in money.</p>
<p>According to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i while
Miy√°nalladev&iacute; and Siddhar√°ja were on pilgrimage
Ya&#347;ovarman king of M√°lwa continually harassed the
Gurjjara-Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala. &#346;√°ntu who was in charge of
the kingdom asked Ya&#347;ovarman on what consideration he would
retire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> Ya&#347;ovarman said he
would retire if Siddhar√°ja gave up to him the merit of the
pilgrimage to Some&#347;vara. S√°ntu washed his feet and taking
water in his hand surrendered to Ya&#347;ovarman the merit of
Siddhar√°ja, on which, according to his promise, Ya&#347;ovarman
retired. On his return Siddhar√°ja asked S√°ntu what he
meant by transferring his sovereign&rsquo;s merit to a rival.
S√°ntu said, &lsquo;If you think my giving Ya&#347;ovarman your
merit has any importance I restore it to you.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="n173.1src" href="#n173.1" name="n173.1src">60</a> This curious
story seems to be a Jain fiction probably invented with the object of
casting ridicule on the Br√°hmanical doctrine of merit.
Ya&#347;ovarman was not a cotemporary of Siddhar√°ja. The
M√°lwa king referred to is probably Ya&#347;ovarman&rsquo;s
predecessor Naravarman, of whom an inscription dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1134 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1190)
is recorded.<a class="noteref" id="n173.2src" href="#n173.2" name="n173.2src">61</a></p>
<p>Under the name Sadharo Jesingh, Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s memory is
fresh in Gujar√°t as its most powerful, most religious, and most
charitable ruler. Almost every old work of architectural or antiquarian
interest in Gujar√°t is ascribed to Siddhar√°ja. In
inscriptions he is styled The great king of kings, The great lord, The
great Bha&#7789;&#7789;√°raka, The lord of Avant&iacute;, The
hero of the three worlds, The conqueror of Barbaraka, The universal
ruler Siddha, The illustrious Jayasim&#803;hadeva. Of these the
commonest attributes are Siddhachakravart&iacute;n the Emperor of Magic
and Siddhar√°ja the Lord of Magic, titles which seem to claim for
the king divine or supernatural powers.<a class="noteref" id="n173.3src" href="#n173.3" name="n173.3src">62</a> In connection with
his assumption of these titles the Kum√°rap√°laprabandha,
the Dvy√°&#347;raya, and the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i
tell curious tales. According to the Dvy√°&#347;raya, the king
wandering by night had subdued the Bh&uacute;tas,
S√°kin&iacute;s, and other spirits. He had also learnt many
<i>mantras</i> or charms. From what he saw at night he would call
people in the day time and say &lsquo;You have such a cause of
uneasiness&rsquo; or &lsquo;You have such a comfort.&rsquo; Seeing that
he knew their secrets the people thought that the king knew the hearts
of all men and must be the <i>avat√°ra</i> of some god. A second
story tells how Siddhar√°ja helped a N√°ga prince and
princess whom he met by night on the Sarasvat&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="n173.4src" href="#n173.4" name="n173.4src">63</a>
According to a third story told in the
Kum√°rap√°laprabandha two Yogin&iacute;s or nymphs came
from the Him√°layas and asked the king by what mystic powers he
justified the use of the title Siddhar√°ja. The king agreed to
perform some wonders in open court in the presence of the nymphs. With
the help of a former minister, Harip√°la, the king had a dagger
prepared whose blade was of sugar and its handle of iron set with
jewels. When the king appeared in court to perform the promised wonders
a deputation of ambassadors from king Perm√°di of <span class="corr" id="xd25e19997" title="Source: Kaly√°nakataka">Kaly√°naka&#7789;aka</span><a class="noteref"

Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> announced. The deputation
entered and presented the prepared dagger as a gift from their lord.
The king kept the prepared dagger and in its stead sent all round the
court a real dagger which was greatly admired. After the real dagger
had been seen and returned the king said: I will use this dagger to
show my mystic powers, and in its place taking the false dagger ate its
sugar blade. When the blade was eaten the minister stopped the king and
said Let the Yogin&iacute;s eat the handle. The king agreed and as the
Yogin&iacute;s failed to eat the handle which was iron the superiority
of the king&rsquo;s magic was proved.</p>
<p>A fourth story in the Dvy√°&#347;raya tells that when the king
was planning an invasion of M√°lwa a Yogin&iacute; came from
Ujjain to Patan and said &lsquo;O R√°ja, if you desire great
fame, come to Ujjain and humbly entreat K√°lika and other
Yogin&iacute;s and make friends with Ya&#347;ovarman the R√°ja of
Ujjain.&rsquo; The king contemptuously dismissed her, saying, &lsquo;If
you do not fly hence like a female crow, I will cut off your nose and
ears with this sword.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So also the king&rsquo;s acts of prowess and courage were believed
to be due to magical aid. According to the common belief
Siddhar√°ja did his great acts of heroism by the help of a demon
named B√°baro, whom he is said to have subdued by riding on a
corpse in a burying ground. The story in the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i is similar to that told of the father
of Harshavardhana who subdued a demon with the help of a Yog&iacute;.
It is notable that the story had passed into its present form within a
hundred years of Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s death. Some&#347;vara in his
K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; says, &lsquo;This moon of kings fettered the
prince of goblins Barbaraka in a burial-place, and became known among
the crowd of kings as Siddhar√°ja.&rsquo; Older records show that
the origin of the story, at least of the demon&rsquo;s name, is
historical being traceable to one of Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s
copperplate attributes Barbaraka-jish&#7751;u that is conqueror of
Barbaraka. The Dvy√°&#347;rayakosha represents this Barbara as a
leader of R√°kshasas or Mlechhas, who troubled the
Br√°hmans at &#346;r&iacute;sthala-Siddhapura. Jayasim&#803;ha
conquered him and spared his life at the instance of his wife
Pin&#775;galik√°. Afterwards Barbara gave valuable presents to
Jayasim&#803;ha and &lsquo;served him as other <span class="corr" id="xd25e20033" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n174.1src" href="#n174.1" name="n174.1src">65</a> Barbaraka

Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> whose head-quarters were
at Jun√°ga&#7693;h. According to the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i Siddhar√°ja went in person to
subdue Noghan or Navaghani the &Aacute;h&iacute;r ruler of
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra; he came to Vardham√°napura that is
Vadhv√°n and from Vadhv√°n attacked and slew Noghan.
Jinaprabhas&uacute;ri the author of the T&iacute;rthakalpa says of
Girn√°r that Jayasim&#803;ha killed the king named Kheng√°r
and made one Sajjana his viceroy in Sur√°sh&#7789;ra. So many
traditions remain regarding wars with Kheng√°r that it seems
probable that Siddhar√°ja led separate expeditions against more
than one king of that name. According to tradition the origin of the
war with Kheng√°r was a woman named
R√°&#7751;akadev&iacute; whom Kheng√°ra had married.
R√°nakadev&iacute; was the daughter of a potter of
Majev√°di village about nine miles north of
Jun√°ga&#7693;h, so famous for her beauty that Siddhar√°ja
determined to marry her. Meanwhile she had accepted an offer from
Kheng√°r whose subject she was and had married him.
Siddhar√°ja enraged at her marriage advanced against
Kheng√°r, took him prisoner, and annexed Sorath. That
Kheng√°r&rsquo;s kingdom was annexed and Sajjana, mentioned by
Jinaprabhas&uacute;ri, was appointed Viceroy is proved by a
Girn√°r inscription dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1120
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1176).</p>
<p>An era called the Sim&#803;ha Sam&#803;vatsara connected with the
name of Jayasim&#803;ha and beginning with <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1113&ndash;1114 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1169&ndash;70), occurs in several inscriptions
found about Prabh√°sa and South
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. This era was probably started in
that year in honour of this conquest of Kheng√°r and
Sorath.<a class="noteref" id="n176.1src" href="#n176.1" name="n176.1src">66</a> The earliest known mention of the Sim&#803;ha
Sam&#803;vatsara era occurs in a step-well at M√°ngrol called the
Sodhali V√°v. The inscription is of the time of
Kum√°rap√°la and mentions Sahajiga the father of
M&uacute;laka the grantor as a member of the bodyguard of the
Ch√°lukyas. The inscription states that Sahajiga had several sons
able to protect Saur√°sh&#7789;ra, one of whom was
Somar√°ja who built the temple of Sahajige&#347;vara, in the
enclosure of the Soman√°tha temple at Prabh√°sa; another
was M&uacute;laka the <i>n√°yaka</i> of <span class="corr" id="xd25e20195" title="Source: Surash&#7789;ra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span>, who is

the Sim&#803;ha era was established by Jayasim&#803;ha, since if the
era belonged to some other local chief, no Ch√°lukya viceroy
would adopt it. The Sim&#803;ha era appears to have been kept up in
Gujar√°t so long as A&#7751;ahilapura rule lasted. The well known

<p>Regarding Sajjana Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s first viceroy in
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra, the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i says that
finding him worthy the king appointed Sajjana the
<i>da&#7751;&#7693;√°dhipati</i> of
Sur√°sh&#7789;rade&#347;a. Without consulting his master Sajjana
spent three years&rsquo; revenue in building a stone temple of

Chapter II.<br>
<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> Nemin√°tha on
Girn√°r instead of a wooden temple which he removed. In the
fourth year the king sent four officers to bring Sajjana to
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. The king called on Sajjana to pay the
revenues of the past three years. In reply Sajjana asked whether the
king would prefer the revenue in cash or the merit which had accrued
from spending the revenue in building the temple. Preferring the merit
the king sanctioned the spending of the revenues on the T&iacute;rtha
and Sajjana was reappointed governor of Sorath.<a class="noteref" id="n177.1src" href="#n177.1" name="n177.1src">67</a> This stone temple of
Sajjana would seem to be the present temple of Nemin√°tha, though
many alterations have been made in consequence of Muhammadan sacrilege
and a modern enclosure has been added. The inscription of Sajjana which
is dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1120 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1176) is on the inside to the right in passing
to the small south gate. It contains little but the mention of the
S√°dhu who was Sajjana&rsquo;s constant adviser. On his return
from a second pilgrimage to Soman√°tha Siddhar√°ja who was
encamped near Raivataka that is Girn√°r expressed a wish to see
Sajjana&rsquo;s temple. But the Br√°hmans envious of the Jains
persuaded the king that as Girn√°r was shaped like a
<i>lin&#775;g</i> it would be sacrilege to climb it. Siddhar√°ja
respected this objection and worshipped at the foot of the mountain.
From Girn√°r he went to &#346;atru&ntilde;jaya. Here too
Br√°hmans with drawn swords tried to prevent the king ascending
the hill. Siddhar√°ja went in disguise at night, worshipped the
Jain god &Aacute;d&iacute;&#347;vara with Ganges water, and granted the
god twelve neighbouring villages. On the hill he saw so luxuriant a
growth of the <i>s√°llaki</i> a plant dear to elephants, that he
proposed to make the hill a breeding place for elephants a second
Vindhya. He was reminded what damage wild elephants would cause to the
holy place and for this reason abandoned his plan.</p>
<p>Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s second and greater war was with
M√°lwa. The cotemporary kings of M√°lwa were the
Param√°ra ruler Naravarman who flourished from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1104 to 1133 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1160&ndash;1189) and his son and successor
Ya&#347;ovarman who ruled up to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1199) the year of
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s death As the names of both these kings occur
in different accounts of this war, and, as the war is said to have
lasted twelve years, it seems that fighting began in the time of
Naravarman and that Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s final victory was gained
in the time of Ya&#347;ovarman in Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s old age
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1134 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1190). This view is supported by the local
story that his expedition against Ya&#347;ovarman was undertaken while
Siddhar√°ja was building the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake and other
religious works. It is not known how the war arose but the statement of
the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i that Siddhar√°ja vowed to
make a scabbard of Ya&#347;ovarman&rsquo;s skin seems to show that
Siddhar√°ja received grave provocation. Siddhar√°ja is said
to have left the building of the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake to the masons
and architects and himself to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178"

Chapter II.<br>
<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> started for M√°lwa.
The war dragged on and there seemed little hope of victory when news
reached Siddhar√°ja that the three south gates of
Dh√°r√° could be forced. With the help of an elephant an
entrance was effected. Ya&#347;ovarman was captured and bound with six
ropes, and, with his captured enemy as his banner of victory,
Siddhar√°ja returned to A&#7751;ahilapura. He remembered his vow,
but being prevented from carrying it out, he took a little of
Ya&#347;ovarman&rsquo;s skin and adding other skin to it made a
scabbard. The captured king was thenceforward kept in a cage. It was
this complete conquest and annexation of M√°lwa that made
Siddhar√°ja assume the style of Avant&iacute;n√°tha
&lsquo;Lord of Avant&iacute;,&rsquo; which is mentioned as his
<i>biru&#7693;a</i> or title in most of the Chaulukya
copperplates.<a class="noteref" id="n178.1src" href="#n178.1" name="n178.1src">68</a> M√°lwa henceforward remained subject to
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. On the return from M√°lwa an army
of Bh&iacute;ls who tried to block the way were attacked by the
minister S√°ntu and put to flight.</p>
<p>Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s next recorded war is with king
Madanavarman the Chandela king of Mahobaka the modern Mahob√° in
Bundelkhand. Madanavarman, of whom General Cunningham has found
numerous inscriptions dating from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1130 to 1164 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1186&ndash;1220),<a class="noteref" id="n178.2src" href="#n178.2" name="n178.2src">69</a> was one of the most
famous kings of the Chandela dynasty. An inscription of one of his
successors in K√°lanjar fort records that Madanavarman &lsquo;in
an instant defeated the king of Gurjjara, as K&#7771;ish&#7751;a in
former times defeated Kam&#803;sa,<a class="noteref" id="n178.3src"
href="#n178.3" name="n178.3src">70</a> a statement which agrees with
the Gujar√°t accounts of the war between him and Jayasim&#803;ha.
In this conflict the Gujar√°t accounts do not seem to show that
Siddhar√°ja gained any great victory; he seems to have been
contented with a money present. The K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; states
that the king of Mahobaka honoured Siddhar√°ja as his guest and
paid a fine and tribute by way of hospitality. The account in the
Kum√°rap√°lacharita suggests that Siddhar√°ja was
compelled to come to terms and make peace. According to the
K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute;, and this seems likely, Siddhar√°ja
went from Dh√°r√° to <span class="corr" id="xd25e20328"
title="Source: K√°la&ntilde;jara">K√°lanjara</span>. The
account in the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i is very confused.
According to the Kum√°rap√°lacharita, on
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s way back from Dh√°r√° at his camp
near Patan a bard came to the court and said to the king that his court
was as wonderful as the court of Madanavarman. The bard said that
Madanavarman was the king of the city of Mahobaka and most clever,
wise, liberal, and pleasure-loving. The king sent a courtier to test
the truth of the bard&rsquo;s statement. The courtier returned after
six months declaring that the bard&rsquo;s account was in no way
exaggerated. Hearing this Siddhar√°ja at once started against
Mahobaka and encamping within sixteen miles of the city sent his
minister to summon Madanavarman to surrender. Madanavarman who was
enjoying himself took little notice of the minister. This king, he
said, is the same who had to fight twelve years with
Dh√°r√°; if, as is probable, since he is a
<i>kab√°di</i> or wild king, he wants money, pay him what he
wants. The money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"

<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> was paid. But
Siddhar√°ja was so struck with Madanavarman&rsquo;s indifference
that he would not leave until he had seen him. Madanavarman agreed to
receive him. Siddhar√°ja went with a large bodyguard to the royal
garden which contained a palace and enclosed pleasure-house and was
guarded by troops. Only four of Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s guards were
allowed to enter. With these four men Siddhar√°ja went in, was
shown the palace garden and pleasure-houses by Madanavarman, was
treated with great hospitality, and on his return to Patan was given a
guard of 120 men.</p>
<p>The Dvy√°&#347;raya says that after his conquest of Ujjain
Siddhar√°ja seized and imprisoned the king of a neighbouring
country named Sim. We have no other information on this point.</p>
<p>The Dohad inscription dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1140
mentions the destruction of Sindhur√°ja that is the king of Sindh
and other kings. The K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; also mentions the
binding of the lord of Sindhu. Nothing is known regarding the Sindh
war. The K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; mentions that after a war with
Ar&#7751;or√°ja king of S√°mbhar Siddhar√°ja gave his
daughter to Ar&#7751;or√°ja. This seems to be a mistake as the
war and alliance with Ar&#7751;or√°ja belong to
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>Siddhar√°ja, who like his ancestors was a &#346;aiva, showed
his zeal for the faith by constructing the two grandest works in
Gujar√°t the Rudramah√°laya at <span class="corr" id="xd25e20363" title="Source: Siddhpur">Sidhpur</span> and the
Sahasralin&#775;ga lake at Patan. The Jain chroniclers always try to
show that Siddhar√°ja was favourably inclined to Jainism. But
several of his acts go against this claim and some even show a dislike
of the Jains. It is true that the Jain sage Hem√°ch√°rya
lived with the king, but the king honoured him as a scholar rather than
as a Jain. On the occasion of the pilgrimage to Soman√°tha the
king offered Hem√°ch√°rya a palanquin, and, as he would not
accept the offer but kept on walking, the king blamed him calling him a
learned fool with no worldly wisdom. Again on one occasion while
returning from M√°lwa Siddhar√°ja encamped at a place
called &#346;r&iacute;nagara, where the people had decorated their
temples with banners in honour of the king. Finding a banner floating
over a Jain temple the king asked in anger who had placed it there, as
he had forbidden the use of banners on Jain shrines and temples in
Gujar√°t. On being told that it was a very old shrine dating from
the time of Bharata, the king ordered that at the end of a year the
banner might be replaced. This shows the reverse of a leaning to
Jainism. Similarly, according to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i,
Hem√°ch√°rya never dared to speak to the king in favour of
Jainism but used to say that all religions were good. This statement is
supported by the fact that the opening verses of all works written by
Hem√°ch√°rya in the time of Siddhar√°ja contain no
special praise of Jain deities.</p>
<p>So great is Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s fame as a builder that almost
every old work in Gujar√°t is ascribed to him. Tradition gives
him the credit of the Dabhoi fort which is of the time of the
V√°ghel√° king V&iacute;radhavala, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1220&ndash;1260. The
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i gives this old verse regarding
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s public works: &lsquo;No one makes a great
temple (Rudramah√°laya), a great pilgrimage (to
Soman√°tha), a great &Aacute;sth√°na (darb√°r hall),
or a great lake (Sahasralin&#775;ga) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

little is left, from its size and the beauty of its carving, must have
been a magnificent work the grandest specimen of the architecture of
the Solan&#775;ki period. The remains of the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake at
A&#7751;ahilapura show that it must have been a work of surprising size
and richness well deserving its title of <i>mah√°sarah&#803;</i>
or great lake. Numerous other public works are ascribed to
Siddhar√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n180.2src" href="#n180.2"

<p>At this period it seems that the kings of Gujar√°t
S√°mbhar and other districts, seeing the great reputation which
his literary tastes had gained for Bhoja of Dh√°r√° used
all to keep Pandits. Certain carvings on the pillars of a mosque at the
south-west of the modern town of Dh√°r√° show that the
building almost as it stands was the Sanskrit school founded by Bhoja.
The carvings in question are beautifully cut Sanskrit grammar tables.
Other inscriptions in praise of Naravarman show that Bhoja&rsquo;s
successors continued to maintain the institution. In the floor of the
mosque are many large shining slabs of black marble, the largest as
much as seven feet long, all of them covered with inscriptions so badly
mutilated that nothing can be made out of them except that they were
Sanskrit and Prakrit verses in honour of some prince. On a rough
estimate the slabs contain as many as 4000 verses.<a class="noteref"
id="n180.3src" href="#n180.3" name="n180.3src">73</a> According to the
old saying any one who drank of the Sarasvat&iacute; well in
Dh√°r√° became a scholar. Sarasvat&iacute;&rsquo;s well
still exists near the mosque. Its water is good and it is still known
as Akkal-kui or the Well of Talent. As in Dh√°r√° so in
Ajmir the A&#7771;h√°&iacute;-dink√° Jhop&#7693;√°
mosque is an old Sanskrit school, recent excavations having brought to
light slabs with entire dramas carved on them. So also the
Gujar√°t kings had their Pandits and their halls of learning.
&#346;r&iacute;p√°la, Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s poet-laureate,
wrote a poetical eulogium or <i>pra&#347;asti</i> on the
Sahasralin&#775;ga lake. According to the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i Siddhar√°ja gathered numerous
Pandits to examine the eulogium. As has already been noticed
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s constant companion was the great scholar and
Jain <i>√°ch√°rya</i> Hemachandra also called
Hem√°ch√°rya, who, under the king&rsquo;s patronage, wrote
a treatise on grammar called Siddhahema, and also the well-known
Dvy√°&#347;rayakosha which was intended to teach both grammar and
the history of the Solan&#775;kis. Hemachandra came into even greater

<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Siddhar√°ja Jayasingha, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1143.</span> prominence in the time of
Kum√°rap√°la, when he wrote several further works and
became closely connected with the state religion. Several stories
remain of Siddhar√°ja assembling poets, and holding literary and
poetic discussions.</p>
<p>Record is preserved of a <i>sabh√°</i> or assembly called by
the king to hear discussions between a &#346;vet√°mbara Jaina
<i><span class="corr" id="xd25e20460" title="Source: √°charya">√°ch√°rya</span></i> named

Devas&uacute;ri and a Digambara Jaina <i>√°ch√°rya</i>
named Kumudachandra who had come from the <span class="corr" id="xd25e20469" title="Source: Karn√°&#7789;ak">Kar&#7751;√°&#7789;ak</span>.
Devas&uacute;ri who was living and preaching in the Jain temple of
Arish&#7789;anemi at <span class="corr" id="xd25e20473" title="Source: Kar&#7751;avat&iacute;">Kar&#7751;√°vat&iacute;</span>,<a class="noteref"
id="n181.1src" href="#n181.1" name="n181.1src">74</a> that is the
modern Ahmad√°b√°d, was there visited by Kumudachandra.
Devas&uacute;ri treated his visitor with little respect telling him to
go to Patan and he would follow and hold a religious discussion or
<i>v√°da</i>. Kumudachandra being a Digambara or skyclad Jaina
went naked to Patan and Siddhar√°ja honoured him because he came
from his mother&rsquo;s country. Siddhar√°ja asked Hemachandra to
hold a discussion with Kumudachandra and Hemachandra recommended that
Devas&uacute;ri should be invited as a worthy disputant. At a
discussion held before a meeting called by the king Kumudachandra was
vanquished, probably because the first principle of his Digambara faith
that no woman can attain <i>nirv√°&#7751;a</i>, was insulting to
the queen-mother, and the second that no clothes-wearing Jain can gain
<i>mukti</i> or absorption, was an insult to the Jain ministers. The
assembly, like Br√°hmanical <i>sabh√°s</i> at the present
day, appears to have declined into noise and Siddhar√°ja had to
interfere and keep order. Devas&uacute;ri was complimented by the king
and taken by one &Aacute;hada with great honour to his newly built
Jaina temple.<a class="noteref" id="n181.2src" href="#n181.2" name="n181.2src">75</a></p>

Siddhar√°ja Jayasim&#803;ha had no son. The throne passed into

Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> king of
&#346;√°kambhari or S√°mbhar, the &Aacute;nalladeva of the
Hamm&iacute;ramah√°k√°vya. Kum√°rap√°la himself
was married by his father to one Bhup√°ladev&iacute;. According
to the Dvy√°&#347;raya, Tribhuvanap√°la was on good terms
with Siddhar√°ja serving him and going with him to war. The
Kum√°rap√°lacharita also states that
Kum√°rap√°la used to attend the court of
Siddhar√°ja<span class="corr" id="xd25e20590" title="Not in source">.</span> But from the time he came to feel that he
would have no son and that the bastard Kum√°rap√°la would
succeed him Siddhar√°ja became embittered against
Kum√°rap√°la. According to the Jain chronicles
Siddhar√°ja was told by the god Soman√°tha, by the sage
Hemachandra, by the goddess Ambik√° of Kodin√°r,<a class="noteref" id="n182.1src" href="#n182.1" name="n182.1src">77</a> and by
astrologers that he would have no son and that Kum√°rap√°la
would be his successor. According to the
Kum√°rap√°lacharita so bitter did his hate grow that
Siddhar√°ja planned the death of Tribhuvanap√°la and his
family including Kum√°rap√°la. Tribhuvanap√°la was
murdered but Kum√°rap√°la escaped. Grieved at this proof of
the king&rsquo;s hatred Kum√°rap√°la consulted his
brother-in-law K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva who advised him to leave his
family at Dahithal&iacute; and go into exile promising to keep him
informed of what went on at A&#7751;ahilapura. Kum√°rap√°la
left in the disguise of a <i>ja&#7789;√°dh√°ri</i> or
recluse and escaped the assassins whom the king had ordered to slay
him. After some time Kum√°rap√°la returned and in spite of
his disguise was recognized by the guards. They informed the king who
invited all the ascetics in the city to a dinner.
Kum√°rap√°la came but noticing that the king recognized him
in spite of his disguise, he fled. The king sent a trusted officer with
a small force in pursuit. Kum√°rap√°la persuaded some
husbandmen, the chief of whom was Bh&iacute;masim&#803;ha, to hide him
in a heap of thorns. The pursuers failing to find him returned. At
night Kum√°rap√°la was let out bleeding from the thorns,
and promised the husbandmen that the day would come when their help
would be rewarded. He then shaved his topknot or
<i>ja&#7789;√°</i> and while travelling met with a lady named
Deva&#347;r&iacute; of Udambara village who pitying him took him into
her chariot and gave him food. Kum√°rap√°la promised to
regard her as a sister. He then came to Dahithal&iacute; where the
royal troops had already arrived. Siddhar√°ja sent an army which
invested the village leaving Kum√°rap√°la without means of
escape. He went to a potter named Sajjana or Alin&#775;ga who hid him
in the flues of his brick-kiln throwing hay over him. The troops
searched the village, failed to find Kum√°rap√°la, and
retired. The potter then helped Kum√°rap√°la from his
hiding place and fed him. A former friend named Bosari joined
Kum√°rap√°la and they went away together
Kum√°rap√°la commending his family to the care of Sajjana.
On the first day they had no food. Next day Bosari went to beg and they
together ate the food given to Bosari in a monastery or
<i>ma&#7789;h</i> where they slept. In time they came to Cambay where
they called upon Hem√°ch√°rya and asked him their future.
Hem√°ch√°rya knew and recognized Kum√°rap√°la.
Kum√°rap√°la asked when fate would bless him. Before
Hem√°ch√°rya <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter II.<br>
<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> could reply Udayana, one
of the king&rsquo;s ministers, came. Hem√°ch√°rya said to
Udayana, &lsquo;This is Kum√°rap√°la who shall shortly be
your king.&rsquo; Hem√°ch√°rya also gave
Kum√°rap√°la a writing stating that he would succeed to the
throne. Kum√°rap√°la acknowledged his obligations to
Hem√°ch√°rya and promised to follow his advice. Udayana
took him to his house and gave him food and clothes. Siddhar√°ja
came to know of this and sent his soldiers who began to search.
Kum√°rap√°la returned to Hem√°ch√°rya who hid
him in a cellar covering its door with manuscripts and palm leaves. The
soldiers came but failed to search under the manuscripts and returned.
Kum√°rap√°la acknowledged his obligations to
Hem√°ch√°rya and said he owed him two great debts one for
telling him the day on which he would come to the throne; the other for
saving his life. Kum√°rap√°la left Cambay at midnight, the
minister Udayana supplying him with provisions. From Cambay he went to
Va&#7789;apadrapura probably Baroda, where feeling hungry he entered
the shop of a V√°nia named Katuka and asked for parched gram. The
V√°nia gave the gram and seeing that Kum√°rap√°la had
no money accepted his promise of future payment. From Baroda he came to
Bhrigukachh or Broach where he saw a soothsayer and asked him his
future. The soothsayer, seeing the bird <i>kali-dev&iacute;</i> perched
on the temple flagstaff, said &lsquo;You will shortly be king.&rsquo;
Kum√°rap√°la shaved his matted hair and went from Broach to
Ujjain where he met his family. But as here too the royal troops
followed him he fled to Kolh√°pura where he came across a
Yog&iacute; who foretold his succession to a throne and gave him two
spells or <i>man&#7789;ras</i>. From Kolh√°pura
Kum√°rap√°la went to K√°&ntilde;ch&iacute; or
Conjeveram and from there to the city of
K√°lambapattana.<a class="noteref" id="n183.1src" href="#n183.1"
name="n183.1src">78</a> The king of K√°lambapattana
Prat√°pasim&#803;ha received him like an elder brother and
brought him into his city, built a temple of &#346;ivananda
Kum√°rap√°le&#347;vara in his honour, and even issued a
coin called a Kum√°rap√°la. From K√°lambapattana
Kum√°rap√°la went to Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a or Chitor and
from there to Ujjain whence he took his family to Siddhapura going on
alone to A&#7751;ahilapura to see his brother-in-law
K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva. According to the <span class="corr" id="xd25e20640" title="Source: Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;&iacute;">Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i</span>
Siddhar√°ja died soon after in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143 on the 3rd of K√°rttika &#346;uddha
Sam&#803;vat 1199.</p>
<p>In the dissensions that followed the king&rsquo;s death
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s interests were well served by his
brother-in-law K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva. Eventually the names of three
candidates, Kum√°rap√°la and two others, were laid before
the state nobles sitting in council to determine who should be king. Of
the three candidates the two others were found wanting, and
Kum√°rap√°la was chosen and installed according to the
Vich√°ra&#347;re&#7751;i on the 4th of
M√°rga&#347;&iacute;rsha Suddha and according to the
Kum√°rap√°laprabandha on the 4th of
M√°rga&#347;&iacute;rsha Vadhya. At the time of his succession,
according to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i and the
Kum√°rap√°laprabandha, Kum√°rap√°la was about
fifty years of age. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"

Kum√°rap√°la and went over to Ar&#7751;or√°ja
&Aacute;n√°ka or Ano king of Sap√°dalaksha or the
S√°mbhar territory who is probably the same as the <span class="corr" id="xd25e20693" title="Source: Analladeva">&Aacute;nalladeva</span> of the

<p>The potter Sajjana was rewarded with a grant of seven hundred
villages near Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a or Chito&#7693;a fort in
R√°jput√°na, and the author of the
Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i notices that in his time the
descendants of the potter ashamed of their origin called themselves
descendants of Sagara. Bh&iacute;masim&#803;ha who hid
Kum√°rap√°la in the thorns was appointed head of the
bodyguard; Deva&#347;r&iacute; made the sister&rsquo;s mark on the
royal forehead at the time of Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s
installation and was granted the village of Devayo;<a class="noteref"
id="n184.3src" href="#n184.3" name="n184.3src">81</a> and Katuka the
V√°ni√° of Baroda, who had given Kum√°rap√°la
parched gram was granted the village of Va&#7789;apadra or Baroda.
Bosari Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s chief companion was given
L√°&#7789;ama&#7751;dala, which seems to mean that he was
appointed viceroy of L√°&#7789;a or South Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>Kanhada or K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s
brother-in-law and adviser overvaluing his great services became
arrogant and disobedient insulting the king in open court. As
remonstrance was of no avail the king had K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva
waylaid and beaten by a band of athletes and taken almost dying to his
wife the king&rsquo;s sister. From this time all the state officers
were careful to show ready obedience.</p>
<p>The old ministry saw that under so capable and well served a ruler
their power was gone. They accordingly planned to slay the king and
place their own nominee on the throne. The king heard of the plot:
secured the assassins: and employed them in murdering the conspirators.
According to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i, &Aacute;hada or
&Aacute;rabha&#7789;&#7789;a who had gone over to the S√°mbhar
king and was in charge of the S√°mbhar infantry, bribed the local
nobles as a preliminary to a war which he had planned against
Kum√°rap√°la. He so far succeeded as to bring &Aacute;na or
&Aacute;n√°ka the S√°mbhar king with the whole of his army
to the borders of Gujar√°t to fight Kum√°rap√°la.
Kum√°rap√°la went to meet &Aacute;n√°ka. But, in
consequence of intrigues, in the battle that followed the
Gujar√°t army did not obey orders. Kum√°rap√°la
advanced in front on an elephant, and B√°ha&#7693;a trying to
climb on Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s elephant was thrown to the
ground and slain. &Aacute;n√°ka was also pierced with arrows and
the S√°mbhar army was defeated and plundered of its
horses.<a class="noteref" id="n184.4src" href="#n184.4" name="n184.4src">82</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"

Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> The
Dvy√°&#347;raya, probably by the aid of the author&rsquo;s
imagination, gives a fuller account of this war. One fact of importance
recorded in the Dvy√°&#347;raya is that &Aacute;n√°ka
though defeated was not slain, and, to bring hostilities to an end,
gave his daughter Jalha&#7751;√° to Kum√°rap√°la in
marriage.<a class="noteref" id="n185.1src" href="#n185.1" name="n185.1src">83</a> The Kum√°rap√°lacharita calls the
S√°mbhar king Ar&#7751;or√°ja and says that it was
Kum√°rap√°la who invaded the S√°mbhar territory.
According to this account Kum√°rap√°la went to
Chandr√°vat&iacute; near &Aacute;bu and taking its
Param√°ra king Vikramasim&#803;ha with him marched to
&#346;√°kambhari or S√°mbhar and fought <span class="corr"
id="xd25e20740" title="Source: &Aacute;r&#7751;or√°ja">Ar&#7751;or√°ja</span> who
was defeated but not killed. Kum√°rap√°la threatened to cut
out Ar&#7751;or√°ja&rsquo;s tongue but let him go on condition
that his people wore a headdress with a tongue on each side.
Ar&#7751;or√°ja is said to have been confined in a cage for three
days and then reinstalled as Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s
feudatory. Vikramasim&#803;ha of Chandr√°vat&iacute;, who in the
battle had sided with Ar&#7751;or√°ja, was punished by being
disgraced before the assembled seventy-two feudatories at
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a and was sent to prison, his throne being
given to his nephew Ya&#347;odhavala. After his victory over
Ar&#7751;or√°ja Kum√°rap√°la fought, defeated, and,
according to the K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute;, beheaded Ball√°la
king of M√°lwa who had invaded Gujar√°t. The result of this
contest seems to have been to reduce M√°lwa to its former
position of dependence on the A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a kings.
More than one inscription of Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s found in
the temple of Uday√°ditya as far north as Udayapura near Bhilsa
shows that he conquered the whole of M√°lwa, as the inscriptions
are recorded by one who calls himself Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s
general or <i>da&#7751;&#7693;an√°yaka</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n185.2src" href="#n185.2" name="n185.2src">84</a></p>
<p>Another of Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s recorded victories is
over Mallik√°rjuna said to be king of the Konkan who we know from
published lists of the North Konkan &#346;il√°h√°ras
flourished about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1160. The author of
the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i says this war arose from a bard of
king Mallik√°rjuna speaking of him before king
Kum√°rap√°la as <i>R√°japit√°maha</i> or
grandfather of kings.<a class="noteref" id="n185.3src" href="#n185.3"
name="n185.3src">85</a> Kum√°rap√°la annoyed at so arrogant
a title looked around. &Aacute;mba&#7693;√°,<a class="noteref"
id="n185.4src" href="#n185.4" name="n185.4src">86</a> one of the sons
of Udayana, divining the king&rsquo;s meaning, raised his folded hands
to his forehead and expressed his readiness to fight
Mallik√°rjuna. The king sent him with an army which marched to
the Konkan without halting. At the crossing of the
Kal√°vin&iacute; it was met and defeated by Mallik√°rjuna.
&Aacute;mba&#7693;√° returned in disgrace and shrouding
himself<span class="corr" id="xd25e20777" title="Not in source">,</span> his umbrella and his tents in crape retreated
to A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a. The king finding &Aacute;mbada
though humiliated ready to make a second venture gave him a larger and
better appointed force. With this army &Aacute;mba&#7693;√° again
started for the Konkan, crossed the Kal√°vin&iacute;, attacked
Mallik√°rjuna, and in a hand-to-hand fight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>

<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> climbed his elephant and
cut off his head. This head cased in gold with other trophies of the
war he presented to the king on his triumphant return to <span class="corr" id="xd25e20800" title="Source: A&#7751;ahil√°pura">A&#7751;ahilapura</span>. The king
was greatly pleased and gave &Aacute;mba&#7693;√° the title of
<i>R√°japit√°maha</i>. Of this Mallik√°rjuna two
stone inscriptions have been found one at Chipl&uacute;n dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1156 (&#346;aka 1078) the other at
Bassein dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1160 (&#346;aka 1082).
If the story that Mallik√°rjuna was slain is true the war must
have taken place during the two years between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1160 and 1162 (&#346;aka 1082, 1084) which latter
is the earliest known date of Mallik√°rjuna&rsquo;s successor
Apar√°ditya.</p>
<p>The Kum√°rap√°lacharita also records a war between
Kum√°rap√°la and Samara king of Sur√°sh&#7789;ra or
south K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, the Gujar√°t army
being commanded by Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s minister Udayana.
The Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i gives Sausara as the name of the
Sur√°sh&#7789;ra king<a class="noteref" id="n186.1src" href="#n186.1" name="n186.1src">87</a>: possibly he was some Gohilv√°d
Mehr chief. Udayana came with the army to Vadhw√°n, and letting
it advance went to P√°lit√°na. While he was worshipping at
P√°lit√°na, a mouse carried away the burning wick of the
lamp. Reflecting on the risk of fire in a wooden temple Udayana
determined to rebuild the temple of stone. In the fight with Sausara
the Gujar√°t army was defeated and Udayana was mortally
wounded.<a class="noteref" id="n186.2src" href="#n186.2" name="n186.2src">88</a> Before Udayana died he told his sons that he had
meant to repair the temple of &Aacute;d&iacute;&#347;vara on
&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya and the &#346;akunik√° Vih√°ra at
Broach and also to build steps up the west face of Girn√°r. His
sons B√°ha&#7693;a and &Aacute;mba&#7693;√° promised to
repair the two shrines. Subsequently both shrines were restored,
Kum√°rap√°la and Hem√°ch√°rya and the council
of A&#7751;ahilapura attending at the installation of
Suv&#7771;ittin√°tha in the &#346;akunik√° Vih√°ra.
The Girn√°r steps were also cut, according to more than one
inscription in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1166 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1222).<a class="noteref" id="n186.3src" href="#n186.3" name="n186.3src">89</a> This war and Udayana&rsquo;s death

<p>The Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i records an expedition against
S√°mbhar which was entrusted to Ch√°ha&#7693;a a younger
brother of B√°ha&#7693;a. Though Ch√°ha&#7693;a was known
to be extravagant, the king liked him, and after giving him advice
placed him in command. On reaching S√°mbhar Ch√°ha&#7693;a
invested the fort of B√°br√°nagar but did not molest the
people as on that day 700 brides had to be married.<a class="noteref"

<p>Though the Gujar√°t chronicles give no further details an

the ruined town of Ker√°du or Kir√°&#7789;a-K&uacute;pa

Mew√°&#7693;a.</p>
<p>According to the Kum√°rap√°lachint√°ma&#7751;i
Kum√°rap√°la married one Padm√°vat&iacute; of
Padmapura. The chronicler describes the city as to the west of the
Indus. Perhaps the lady belonged to Padmapura<span class="corr" id="xd25e21045" title="Not in source">,</span> a large town in
Kashm&iacute;r. Considering his greatness as a king and conqueror the
historical record of Kum√°rap√°la is meagre and incomplete.
Materials may still come to light which will show his power to have
been surprisingly widespread.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes<a class="noteref" id="n188.2src" href="#n188.2" name="n188.2src">95</a> records the following Br√°hmanical tradition
of a Mew√°&#7693;a queen of Kum√°rap√°la, which has
probably been intentionally omitted by the Jain chroniclers.</p>
<p>Kum√°rap√°la, says the Br√°hman tradition, had
wedded a Sisodan&iacute; R√°ni, a daughter of the house of
Mew√°&#7693;a. At the time that the sword went for her the
Sisodan&iacute; heard that the R√°ja had made a vow that his
wives should receive initiation into the Jain religion at
Hem√°ch√°rya&rsquo;s convent before entering the palace.
The R√°ni refused to start for Patan until she was satisfied she
would not be called on to visit the &Aacute;ch√°rya&rsquo;s
convent. Jayadeva Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s household bard
became surety and the queen consented to go to A&#7751;ahilapura.
Several days after her arrival Hem√°ch√°rya said to the
R√°ja &lsquo;The Sisodan&iacute; R√°ni has never come to
visit me.&rsquo; Kum√°rap√°la told her she must go. The
R√°ni refused and fell ill, and the bard&rsquo;s wives went to
see her. Hearing her story they disguised her as one of themselves and
brought her privately home to their house. At night the bard dug a hole
in the wall of the city, and taking the R√°ni through the hole
started with her for Mew√°&#7693;a. When Kum√°rap√°la
became aware of the R√°ni&rsquo;s flight he set off in pursuit
with two thousand horse. He came up with the fugitives about fifteen
miles from the fort of Idar. The bard said to the R√°ni,
&lsquo;If you can enter Idar you are safe. I have two hundred horse
with me. As long as a man of us remains no one shall lay <span class="corr" id="xd25e21055" title="Source: -"></span>hands on you.&rsquo; So
saying he turned upon his pursuers. But the R√°ni&rsquo;s courage
failed and she slew herself in the carriage. As the fight went on and
the pursuers forced their way to the carriage, the maids cried
&lsquo;Why struggle more, the R√°ni is dead.&rsquo;
Kum√°rap√°la and his men returned home.<a class="noteref"

<p>The Param√°ra chiefs of Chandr√°vat&iacute; near
&Aacute;bu were also feudatories of Kum√°rap√°la. It has
been noted that to punish him for siding with Ar&#7751;or√°ja of
S√°mbhar Kum√°rap√°la placed Vikrama Sim&#803;ha the
Chandr√°vat&iacute; chief in confinement and set Vikrama&rsquo;s

S√°mbhar and M√°lwa is beyond question. Among his names is
the proud title Avant&iacute;-n√°tha Lord of M√°lwa.</p>
<p>The Kum√°rap√°laprabandha gives the following limits of
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s sway. The Turushkas or Turks on the
north; the heavenly Ganges on the east; the Vindhya mountains on the
south; the Sindhu river on the west.<a class="noteref" id="n189.1src"
href="#n189.1" name="n189.1src">97</a> Though in tradition
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s name does not stand so high as a
builder as the name of Siddhar√°ja Jayasim&#803;ha he carried out
several important works. The chief of these was the restoring and
rebuilding of the great shrine of Some&#347;vara or Soman√°tha
Patan. According to the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i when
Kum√°rap√°la asked Devas&uacute;ri the teacher of
Hem√°ch√°rya how best to keep his name remembered
Devas&uacute;ri replied: Build a new temple of Soman√°tha fit to
last an age or <i>yuga</i>, instead of the wooden one which is ruined
by the ocean billows. Kum√°rap√°la approved and appointed a
building committee or <i>pa&ntilde;chakula</i> headed by a
Br√°hman named Ga&#7751;&#7693;a Bh√°va B&#7771;ihaspati
the state officer at Soman√°tha. At the instance of
Hem√°ch√°rya the king on hearing the foundations were laid
vowed until the temple was finished he would keep apart from women and
would take neither flesh nor wine. In proof of his vow he poured a
handful of water over N&iacute;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha Mah√°deva,
probably his own royal god. After two years the temple was completed
and the flag hoisted. Hem√°ch√°rya advised the king not to
break his vow until he had visited the new temple and paid his
obeisance to the god. The king agreed and went to Soman√°tha,
Hem√°ch√°rya preceding him on foot and promising to come to
Soman√°tha after visiting <span class="corr" id="xd25e21106"
title="Source: Satru&ntilde;jaya">&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya</span> and
Girn√°r. On reaching Soman√°tha the king was received by
Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati his head local officer and by the
building committee, and was taken in state through the town. At the
steps of the temple the king bowed his head to the ground. Under the
directions of Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati he worshipped the god,
made gifts of elephants and other costly articles including his own
weight in coin, and returned to A&#7751;ahilapura.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that the present battered sea-shore temple
of Soman√°tha, whose <i>garbh√°g√°ra</i> or shrine
has been turned into a mosque and whose spire has been shattered, is
the temple of whose building and consecration the above details are
preserved. This is shown by the style of the architecture and sculpture
which is in complete agreement with the other buildings of the time of
Kum√°rap√°la.<a class="noteref" id="n189.2src" href="#n189.2" name="n189.2src">98</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"

Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span>
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s temple seems to have suffered in every
subsequent Muhammadan invasion, in Alaf Khan&rsquo;s in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1300, in Mozaffar&rsquo;s in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1390, in Mahm&uacute;d Begada&rsquo;s about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1490, and in Muzaffar II.&rsquo;s
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1530. Time after time no sooner
had the invader passed than the work of repair began afresh. One of the
most notable restorations was by Kheng√°r IV. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1279&ndash;1333) a <span class="corr" id="xd25e21156" title="Source: Chud√°sam√°">Ch&uacute;&#7693;√°sam√°</span>
king of Jun√°ga&#7693;h who is mentioned in two Girn√°r
inscriptions as the repairer of Soman√°tha after its desecration
by <span class="corr" id="xd25e21159" title="Source: Ala-ud-din">Al√°-ud-d&iacute;n</span> Khilji. The latest
sacrilege, including the turning of the temple into a mosque, was in
the time of the Ahmad√°b√°d king Muzaffar Sh√°h II.
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1511&ndash;1535). Since then no
attempt has been made to win back the god into his old home.</p>
<p>In the side wall near the door of the little shrine of
Bhadrak√°li in Patan a broken stone inscription gives interesting
details of the temple of Soman√°tha. Except that the right hand
corners of some of the lines are broken, the inscription is clear and
well preserved. It is dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1169
(Valabhi 850). It records that the temple of the god Some&#347;a was
first of gold built by Soma; next it was of silver built by
R√°vana; afterwards of wood built by <span class="corr" id="xd25e21170" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>; and
last of stone built by Bh&iacute;madeva. The next restoration was
through Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati under
Kum√°rap√°la. Of Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati it
gives these details. He was a Kany√°kubja or Kanoj Br√°hman
of the P√°&#347;upata school, a teacher of the M√°lwa
kings, and a friend of Siddhar√°ja Jayasim&#803;ha. He repaired
several other temples and founded several other religious buildings in
Soman√°tha. He also repaired the temple of
Ked√°re&#347;vara in Kumaon on learning that the Kha&#347;a king
of that country had allowed it to fall into disrepair. After the time
of Kum√°rap√°la the descendants of
Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati remained in religious authority in
Soman√°tha.</p>
<p>Kum√°rap√°la made many Jain benefactions.<a class="noteref" id="n190.1src" href="#n190.1" name="n190.1src">99</a> He
repaired the temple of S√°gala-Vasahik√° at
Stambha-t&iacute;rtha or Cambay where Hem√°ch√°rya received
his initiation or <i>d&iacute;ksh√°</i>. In honour of the lady
who gave him barley flour and curds he built a temple called the
Karambaka-Vih√°ra in Patan. He also built in Patan a temple
called the Mouse or Mushaka-Vih√°ra to free himself from the
impurity caused by killing a mouse while digging for treasure. At
Dhandhuka Hem√°ch√°rya&rsquo;s birthplace a temple called
the Jholik√°-Vih√°ra or cradle temple was built. Besides
these Kum√°rap√°la is credited with building 1444
temples.</p>
<p>Though Kum√°rap√°la was not a learned man, his ministers
were men of learning, and he continued the practice of keeping at his
court scholars especially Sanskrit poets. Two of his leading Pandits
were R√°machandra and Udayachandra both of them Jains.
R√°machandra is often mentioned in Gujar√°ti literature and
appears to have been a great scholar. He was the author of a book
called the Hundred Accounts or Prabandha&#347;ata. After
Udayana&rsquo;s death Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s chief minister
was Kapardi a man of learning skilled in Sanskrit poetry. And all
through his reign his principal adviser <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> was Hemachandra or
Hem√°ch√°rya probably the most learned man of his time.
Though Hem√°ch√°rya lived during the reigns both of
Siddhar√°ja and of Kum√°rap√°la, only under
Kum√°rap√°la did he enjoy political power as the
king&rsquo;s companion and religious adviser. What record remains of
the early Solan&#775;kis is chiefly due to Hemachandra.</p>
<p>The Jain life of Hem√°ch√°rya abounds in wonders. Apart
from the magic and mystic elements the chief details are:
Ch√°chiga a Modh V√°nia of Dhandhuka<a class="noteref" id="n191.1src" href="#n191.1" name="n191.1src">100</a> in the district of
Ardh√°sh&#7789;ama had by his wife P√°hin&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="n191.2src" href="#n191.2" name="n191.2src">101</a> of the
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a <i><span class="corr" id="xd25e21212"
title="Source: g&ograve;tra">gotra</span></i>, a boy named
Ch√°ngodeva who was born <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1089
(Kartik fullmoon Sam&#803;vat 1145). A Jain priest named Devachandra
&Aacute;ch√°rya (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1078&ndash;1170; <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1134&ndash;1226) came from Patan to Dhandhuka
and when in Dhandhuka went to pay his obeisance at the Modh
Vasahik√°. While Devachandra was seated Ch√°ngodeva came
playing with other boys and went and sat beside the
<i>√°ch√°rya</i>. Struck with the boy&rsquo;s audacity and
good looks the <i>√°ch√°rya</i> went with the council of
the village to Ch√°chiga&rsquo;s house. Ch√°chiga was
absent but his wife being a Jain received the
<i>√°ch√°rya</i> with respect. When she heard that her son
was wanted by the council, without waiting to consult her husband, she
handed the boy to the <i>√°ch√°rya</i> who carried him off
to Kar&#7751;√°vat&iacute; and kept him there with the sons of
the minister Udayana. Ch√°chiga, disconsolate at the loss of his
son, went in quest of him vowing to eat nothing till the boy was found.
He came to Kar&#7751;√°vat&iacute; and in an angry mood called on
the <i>√°ch√°rya</i> to restore him his son. Udayana was
asked to interfere and at last persuaded Ch√°chiga to let the boy
stay with Devachandra.</p>
<p>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1097, when Ch√°ngodeva
was eight years old Ch√°chiga celebrated his son&rsquo;s
consecration or <i>d&iacute;ksh√°</i> and gave him the name of
Somachandra. As the boy became extremely learned Devachandra changed
his name to Hemachandra the Moon of gold. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1110 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1166)
at the age of 21, his mastery of all the &#346;√°stras and
Siddh√°ntas was rewarded by the dignity of S&uacute;ri or sage.
Siddhar√°ja was struck with his conversation and honoured him as
a man of learning. Hemachandra&rsquo;s knowledge<span class="corr" id="xd25e21254" title="Not in source">,</span> wisdom and tact enabled him
to adhere openly to his Jain rules and beliefs though
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s dislike of Jain practices was so great as at
times to amount to insult. After one of their quarrels
Hem√°ch√°rya kept away from the king for two or three days.
Then the king seeing his humility and his devotion to his faith
repented and apologised. The two went together to Soman√°tha
Patan and there Hem√°ch√°rya paid his obeisance to the
<i>lin&#775;ga</i> in a way that did not offend his own faith. During
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s reign Hem√°ch√°rya wrote his well
known grammar with aphorisms or <i>s&uacute;tras</i> and commentary or
<i>v&#7771;itti</i> called Siddha-Hemachandra, a title compounded of
the king&rsquo;s name and his own. As the Br√°hmans found fault
with the absence of any detailed references to the king in the work
Hemachandra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Chapter II.<br>
<span class="sc">The Chaulukyas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242.</span><br>
Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> added one verse at the
end of each chapter in praise of the king. During
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s reign he also wrote two other works, the
Haim&iacute;n√°mam√°l√°, &ldquo;String of Names
composed by Hema(chandra)&rdquo; or
Abhidh√°nachint√°ma&#7751;i and the
Anek√°rthan√°mam√°l√°<span class="corr" id="xd25e21286" title="Not in source">,</span> a Collection of words of
more than one meaning. He also began the
Dvy√°&#347;rayakosha<a class="noteref" id="n192.1src" href="#n192.1" name="n192.1src">102</a> or Double Dictionary being both a
grammar and a history. In spite of his value to
Kum√°rap√°la, in the beginning of
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s reign Hem√°ch√°rya was not
honoured as a spiritual guide and had to remain subordinate to
Br√°hmans. When Kum√°rap√°la asked him what was the
most important religious work he could perform Hem√°ch√°rya
advised the restoring of the temple of Soman√°tha. Still
Hem√°ch√°rya so far won the king to his own faith that till
the completion of the temple he succeeded in persuading the king to
take the vow of <i>ahim&#775;s√°</i> or non-killing which though
common to both faiths is a specially Jain observance. Seeing this mark
of his ascendancy over the king, the king&rsquo;s family priest and
other Br√°hmans began to envy and thwart
Hem√°ch√°rya. On the completion of the temple, when the
king was starting for Soman√°tha for the installation ceremony,
the Br√°hmans told him that Hem√°ch√°rya did not mean
to go with him. Hem√°ch√°rya who had heard of the plot had
already accepted the invitation. He said being a recluse he must go on
foot, and that he also wanted to visit Girn√°r, and from
Girn√°r would join the king at Soman√°tha. His object was
to avoid travelling in a palanquin with the king or suffering a
repetition of Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s insult for not accepting a
<i>p√°lk&iacute;</i>. Soon after reaching Soman√°tha
Kum√°rap√°la asked after Hem√°ch√°rya. The
Br√°hmans spread a story that he had been drowned, but
Hem√°ch√°rya was careful to appear in the temple as the
king reached it. The king saw him, called him, and took him with him to
the temple. Some Br√°hmans told the king that the Jain priest
would not pay any obeisance to <span class="corr" id="xd25e21301"
title="Source: Siva">&#346;iva</span>, but Hem√°ch√°rya
saluted the god in the following verse in which was nothing contrary to
strict Jainism: &lsquo;Salutation to him, whether he be Brahma,
<span class="corr" id="xd25e21304" title="Source: Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</span>, Hara, or Jina, from whom have
fled desires which produce the sprouts of the seed of
worldliness.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n192.2src" href="#n192.2"
name="n192.2src">103</a> After this joint visit to Soman√°tha
Hemachandra gained still more ascendancy over the king, who appreciated
his calmness of mind and his forbearance. The Br√°hmans tried to
prevent the growth of his influence, but in the end Hemachandra
overcame them. He induced the king to place in the sight of his
Br√°hmanical family priests an image of
&#346;√°ntin√°tha T&iacute;rthan&#775;kara among his family
gods. He afterwards persuaded Kum√°rap√°la publicly to
adopt the Jain faith by going to the hermitage of Hemachandra and
giving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Kum√°rap√°la, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1143&ndash;1174.</span> numerous presents to Jain
ascetics. Finally under his influence Kum√°rap√°la put away
all Br√°hmanical images from his family place of worship. Having
gone such lengths Kum√°rap√°la began to punish the
Br√°hmans who insulted Hemachandra. A Br√°hman named
V√°mar√°&#347;i, a Pandit at the royal court, who composed
a verse insulting Hemachandra, lost his annuity and was reduced to
beggary, but on apologising to Hemachandra the annuity was restored.
Another Br√°hmanical officer named Bh√°va B&#7771;ihaspati,
who was stationed at Soman√°tha, was re-called for insulting
Hemachandra. But he too on apologising to Hemachandra was restored to
Soman√°tha. Under Hemachandra&rsquo;s influence
Kum√°rap√°la gave up the use of flesh and wine, ceased to
take pleasure in the chase, and by beat of drum forbade throughout his
kingdom the taking of animal life. He withdrew their licenses from
hunters<span class="corr" id="xd25e21350" title="Not in source">,</span> fowlers and fishermen, and forced them to
adopt other callings. To what lengths this dread of life-taking was
carried appears from an order that only filtered water was to be given
to all animals employed in the royal army. Among the stories told of
the king&rsquo;s zeal for life-saving is one of a Bania of
S√°mbhar who having been caught killing a louse was brought in
chains to A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a, and had his property
confiscated and devoted to the building at
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a of a Louse Temple or
Y&uacute;k√°-Vih√°ra. According to another story a man of
Nador in M√°rw√°r was put to death by Kelhana the chief of
Nador to appease Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s wrath at hearing that
the man&rsquo;s wife had offered flesh to a field-god or
<i>kshetrap√°la</i>. Hemachandra also induced the king to forego
the claim of the state to the property of those who died without a
son.</p>
<p>During Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s reign Hemachandra wrote many
well known Sanskrit and Prakrit works on literature and religion. Among
these are the Adhy√°tmopanishad or Yoga&#347;√°stra a work
of 12,000 verses in twelve chapters called Prak√°&#347;as, the
Tris√°sh&#7789;his√°l√°k√°purushacharitra or
lives of sixty-three Jain saints of the Utsarpin&iacute; and
Avasarpin&iacute; ages; the Pari&#347;ish&#7789;aparvan, a work of 3500
verses being the life of Jain Sthaviras who flourished after
Mah√°v&iacute;ra; the Pr√°k&#7771;ita
&#346;abd√°nu&#347;√°sana or Pr√°krit grammar; the
Dvy√°&#347;raya<a class="noteref" id="n193.1src" href="#n193.1"
name="n193.1src">104</a> a Prakrit poem written with the double object
of teaching grammar and of giving the history of
Kum√°rap√°la; the Chhandonu&#347;√°sana a work of
about 6000 verses on prosody; the
Lin&#775;g√°nu&#347;√°sana a work on genders; the
De&#347;&iacute;n√°mam√°l√° in Prakrit with a
commentary a work on local and provincial words; and the
Alan&#775;k√°rach&uacute;&#7693;√°ma&#7751;i a work on
rhetoric. Hemachandra died in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1172
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1229) at the age of 84. The king
greatly mourned his loss and marked his brow with Hemachandra&rsquo;s
ashes. Such crowds came to share in the ashes of the pyre that the
ground was hollowed into a pit known as the Haima-Khadda or
Hema&rsquo;s Pit.</p>
<p>Kum√°rap√°la lived to a great age. According to the
author of the Prabandhachint√°ma&#7751;i he was fifty when he

about thirty-one years died in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1174
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1230). He is said to have died of
<i>l&uacute;ta</i> a form of leprosy. Another story given by the
Kum√°rap√°laprabandha is that Kum√°rap√°la was
imprisoned by his nephew and successor Ajayap√°la. The
Kum√°rap√°laprabandha gives the exact length of
Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s reign at 30 years 8 months and 27
days. If the beginning of Kum√°rap√°la&rsquo;s reign is
placed at the 4th Magsar Sud Sam&#803;vat 1299, the date of the close,
taking the year to begin in K√°rtika, would be Bh√°drapada
&#346;uddha Sam&#803;vat 1229. If with Gujar√°t almanacs the year
is taken to begin in &Aacute;sh√°&#7693;ha, the date of the close
of the reign would be Bh√°drapada of Sam&#803;vat 1230. It is
doubtful whether either Sam&#803;vat 1229 or 1230 is the correct year,
as an inscription dated Sam&#803;vat 1229 Vaish√°kha &#346;uddha

K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; says that he came to the throne while still

younger brother of M&uacute;lar√°ja. Bh&iacute;ma probably came
to the throne <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1178 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1234). There is no doubt he was reigning in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1179 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1235), as an inscription in the deserted
village of Ker√°lu near B√°lmer of
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1179 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1235)
states that it was written &lsquo;in the triumphant reign of the
illustrious Bh&iacute;madeva.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n196.1src"
href="#n196.1" name="n196.1src">115</a> A further proof of his reigning
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1179 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1235) and of his being a minor at that time is
given in the following passage from the

Nahrw√°l√° Bh&iacute;mdeo, was a minor, but he had a large

Merutu&#7751;ga says that Bh&iacute;ma reigned from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1179 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1235)
for sixty-three years that is up to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1242 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1298),
and this is borne out by a copperplate of Bh&iacute;ma which bears date

<p>Bh&iacute;ma was nicknamed Bholo the Simpleton. The chroniclers of
this period mention only the V√°ghel√°s and almost pass
over Bh&iacute;ma. The author of the K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; says
&lsquo;the kingdom of the young ruler was gradually divided among
powerful ministers and provincial chiefs&rsquo;; and according to the
Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana &lsquo;Bh&iacute;ma felt great anxiety
on account of the chiefs who had forcibly eaten away portions of the
kingdom.&rsquo; It appears that during the minority, when the central
authority was weak, the kingdom was divided among nobles and
feudatories, and that Bh&iacute;ma proved too weak a ruler to restore
the kingly power. Manuscripts and copperplates show that
Bh&iacute;madeva was ruling at A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a in
<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1247, 1251, 1261, 1263, and

title="Source: 1888">1288</span>, 1295, and 1296 have also been found.
Though Bh&iacute;ma in name enjoyed a long unbroken reign the verses
quoted above show that power rested not with the king but with the
nobles. It appears from an inscription that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1224 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1280)
a Ch√°lukya noble named Jayantasim&#803;ha was supreme at
A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a though he mentions Bh&iacute;ma and his
predecessors with honour and respect.<a class="noteref" id="n196.6src"
href="#n196.6" name="n196.6src">120</a></p>
<p>It was probably by aiding Bh&iacute;ma against Jayantasim&#803;ha
that the V√°ghel√°s rose to power. According to the
chroniclers the V√°ghel√°s succeeded in the natural course
of things. According to the Suk&#7771;itasank&iacute;rtana
Kum√°rap√°la appeared to his grandson Bh&iacute;ma and
directed him to appoint as his heir-apparent V&iacute;radhavala son of

Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a as king at the time of

remarks in <abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 184. Of
Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s return to Ghazni (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1026) the <span class="corr" id="xd25e19671"
title="Source: Tabak√°t-i-Akbar&iacute;">Tabak√°t-i-Akbari</span>
says: &lsquo;When Mahm&uacute;d resolved to return from
Soman√°tha he learned that Parama Dev, one of the greatest
R√°j√°s of Hindust√°n, was preparing to intercept
him. The Sult√°n, not deeming it advisable to contend with this
chief, went towards Mult√°n through Sindh. In this journey his
men suffered much in some places from scarcity of water in others from
want of forage. After enduring great difficulties he arrived at Ghazni
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1029 (H. 417).&rsquo; This Parama
Dev would seem to be the Parm√°ra king of &Aacute;bu who could
well block the Ajmir-Gujar√°t route. The route taken by
Mahm&uacute;d must have passed by Mans&uacute;ra near
Br√°hman√°b√°d, Bh√°tia, and Mult√°n. It
must have been in the crossing of the great desert that he suffered so
severely from scarcity of water and forage. Ferishta (Briggs, I. 75)
says that many of Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s troops died raging mad from the
intolerable heat and thirst. The historian Muhammad Ufi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1200) alleges (Elliot, II. 192) that two Hindus
disguised as countrymen offered themselves as guides and led the army
three days&rsquo; march out of the right course, where they were saved
only by Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s miraculous discovery of a pool of sweet
water. [This tale of the self-sacrificing Br√°hman or priest and
the miraculous find of water has gathered round Mahm&uacute;d as the
latest of myth centres. It is Herodotus&rsquo; (Book III.
154&ndash;158) old Zopyrus tale (Rawlinson&rsquo;s Seventh Monarchy,
318); it is revived in honour of the Great Kush√°n Kanishka,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78 (Beruni in Elliot, II. 11), of the
Sassanian Firoz <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;457&ndash;483
(Rawlinson&rsquo;s Seventh Monarchy, 318), and of a certain king of
Z√°bulist√°n or Ghazni of uncertain date (Elliot II. 170).
Similarly the puzzling Dabshil&iacute;m tale seems to be peculiar
neither to Gujar√°t nor to Mahm&uacute;d of Ghazni. It seems a
repetition of the tale of Dabshil&iacute;m the man of the royal race,
who, according to the Panchatantra or Fables of Pilpai, was chosen
successor of Porus after Alexander the Great&rsquo;s Viceroy had been
driven out. [Compare Reinaud&rsquo;s <span lang="fr">M&eacute;moire Sur
l&rsquo;Inde</span>, 127&ndash;128.] The
Tabak√°t-i-N√°sir&iacute; (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1227) adds (Elliot, II. 475) that the guide
devoted his life for the sake of Soman√°tha and this account is

VI. 167: &lsquo;The Varvarakas are one of the non-Aryan tribes which
are settled in great numbers in North <span class="corr" id="xd25e20043" title="Source: Guj√°r√°t">Gujar√°t</span>, Koli,
Bh&iacute;l, or Mer.&rsquo; Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s contests with the
Barbarakas seem to refer to what Tod (Western India, 173 and 195)
describes as the inroads of mountaineers and foresters on the plains of
Gujar√°t during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. To attempt to
identify Bhut Barbar or Varvar is hazardous. The name Barbar is of
great age and is spread from India to Morocco. Wilson (Works, VII. 176)
says: The analogy between Barbaras and barbarians is not in sound only.
In all Sanskrit authorities Barbaras are classed with borderers and
foreigners and nations not Hindu. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson
(Ferrier&rsquo;s Caravan <span class="corr" id="xd25e20046" title="Source: Journies">Journeys</span>, 223 note) tribes of Berbers are
found all over the east. Of the age of the word Canon Rawlinson
(Herodotus, IV. 252) writes: Barbar seems to be the local name for the
early race of Accad. In India Ptolemy (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150; McCrindle&rsquo;s Edn. 146) has a town
Barbarei on the Indus and the Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247; McCrindle&rsquo;s Ed. 108) has a
trade-centre Barbarikon on the middle mouth of the Indus. Among Indian
writings, in the <span class="corr" id="xd25e20056" title="Source: Ram√°yana">Ram√°ya&#7751;a</span> (Hall in
Wilson&rsquo;s Works, VII. 176 Note *) the Barbaras appear between the
Tukh√°ras and the Kambojas in the north: in the
Mah√°bh√°rata (Muir&rsquo;s Sanskrit Texts, I. 481&ndash;2)
in one list Var-varas are entered between S√°varas and &#346;akas
and in another list (Wilson&rsquo;s Works, VII. 176) Barbaras come
between Kiratas and Siddhas. Finally (<abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr> XV. 47 footnote) Barbara is the
northmost of the Seven Konkanas. The names Barbarei in Ptolemy and
Barbarikon in the Periplus look like some local place-name, perhaps
Bambhara, altered to a Greek form. The Hindu tribe names, from the
sameness in sound as well as from their position on the north-west
border of India, suggest the Mongol tribe Ju√°n-Ju√°n or
Var-Var, known to the western nations as <span class="corr" id="xd25e20064" title="Source: Av√°rs">Avars</span>, who drove the
Little Yuechi out of Balkh in the second half of the fourth century,
and, for about a hundred years, ruled to the north and perhaps also to
the south of the Hindu Kush. (Specht in Journal Asiatique 1883. II.
390&ndash;410; Howorth in <abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">Jour. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI.
721&ndash;810.) It seems probable that some of these Var-Vars passed
south either before or along with the White <span class="corr" id="xd25e20070" title="Source: Hu&#7751;as">H&uacute;&#7751;as</span>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450&ndash;550). Var, under its
Mongol plural form Avarti (Howorth, Ditto 722), closely resembles
Avartiya one of the two main divisions of the K√°this of Kacch
(Mr. Erskine&rsquo;s List in J. Bom. Geo. Soc. II. 59&ndash;60 for Aug.
1838). That among the forty-seven clans included under the Avartiyas
four (Nos. 30, 35, 42, and 43) are Babariyas, suggests that the
K√°this received additions from the Var-Vars at different times
and places. Dr. B&uuml;hler (<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind.
Ant.</abbr> VI. 186) thinks that the Babaro or Barbar or Var-Var who
gave trouble to Siddhar√°ja represent some early local non-Aryan
tribe. The fact that they are called R√°kshasas and Mlecchas and
that they stopped the ceremonies at <span class="corr" id="xd25e20080"
title="Source: Siddhpur">Sidhpur</span> north of <span class="corr" id="xd25e20083" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
seems rather to point to a foreign invasion from the north than to a
local uprising of hill tribes. Though no Musalm√°n invasion of
Gujar√°t during the reign of Siddhar√°ja is recorded a
Jesalmir legend (Forbes&rsquo; R√°s M√°l√°, I. 175)
tells how Lanja Bijirao the Bhatti prince who married
Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s daughter was hailed by his mother-in-law as
the bulwark of <span class="corr" id="xd25e20086" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
against the power of the king who grows too strong. This king may be
B√°halim the Indian viceroy of the Ghaznavid Bahr√°m
Sh√°h (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1116&ndash;1157).
B√°halim (Elliot, II. 279; Briggs&rsquo; Ferista, I. 151)
collected an army of Arabs, Persians, Afgh√°ns, and Khiljis,
repaired the fort of N√°gor in the province of Sew√°lik,
and committed great devastations in the territories of the independent
Indian rulers. He threw off allegiance to Ghazni and advancing to meet
Bahr√°m Sh√°h near Mult√°n was defeated and slain.
Except that they were northerners and that B√°halim&rsquo;s is
the only known invasion from the north during Siddhar√°ja&rsquo;s
reign nothing has been found connecting Barbar and B√°halim. At
the same time that the Barbar or Var-Var of the Gujar√°t writers
may have been non-Hindu mercenaries from the north-west frontier whom
Siddhar√°ja admitted as Hindu subjects is made not unlikely by
two incidents preserved by the Muhammadan historians. The
T√°rikh-i-Sor√°th (Bayley&rsquo;s Gujar√°t, 35 Note
*) tells how in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1178 from the
defeated army of Shah√°b-ud-din Ghori the Turkish Afgh√°n
and Moghal women were distributed the higher class to high caste and
the commoner to low caste Hindus. Similarly how the better class of
male captives were <span class="corr" id="xd25e20096" title="Source: ad mitted">admitted</span> among Chak√°val and
Wadh√°l <span class="corr" id="xd25e20099" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> and the lower among
Kh√°nts, Kolis, B√°brias, and Mers. Again about thirty
years later (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1210) when his Turk
mercenaries, who were not converted to Isl√°m, revolted against
<span class="corr" id="xd25e20105" title="Source: Shamsu-ud-din">Shams-ud-d&iacute;n</span> Altamsh they seized
Delhi and built Hindu temples (Elliot, II. 237&ndash;239). These cases
seem to make it likely that among B√°halim&rsquo;s mercenaries
were some un-Islamised North Indian Var-Vars and that they were
admitted into Hinduism by Siddhar√°ja and as the story states
served him as other <span class="corr" id="xd25e20108" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>. Some of the new-comers as
noted above seem to have merged into the K√°this. Others founded
or joined the <span class="corr" id="xd25e20112" title="Source: Babari√°s">B√°bari√°s</span> who give their
name to B√°bari√°v√°&#7693;a a small division in the
south of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Though the tribe is now
small the 72 divisions of the B√°bari√°s show that they
were once important. One of their leading divisions preserves the early
form Var (K√°thi√°w√°r Gazetteer, 132&ndash;133) and
supports their separate northern origin, which is forgotten in the
local stories that they are descended from <span class="corr" id="xd25e20115" title="Source: Jetvas">Jethv√°s</span> and Ahirs and
have a Br√°hman element in their ancestry. (Tod&rsquo;s Western
India, 413; K√°thi√°w√°r Gazetteer, 132&ndash;123.)
Of the Var-Vars in their old seats a somewhat doubtful trace remains in
the Barbaris a tribe of Haz√°r√°hs near Herat (Bellew in
Imp. and As. Quar. Review Oct. 1891 page 328) and in the Panj√°b

Soman√°tha whose arms were raised by a hidden priest pulling a

admitted behind the shrine, discovered the cord-puller, threw him into
a well, and fled. Compare Journal Royal Asiatic Society Bengal

Kum√°rap√°la expelled the tribe of L√°r from his

<span class="corr" id="xd25e21410" title="Source: L√°ta">L√°&#7789;a</span> or South Gujar√°t
or with the caste of L√°d V√°nis seems unlikely. The
alternative is P√°rsis from Lar on the Persian Gulf whom Tod
(Annals of Rajasth√°n, I. 235) notices as sending an expedition
from Laristh√°n to Gujar√°t. In this connection it is

this event than its importance deserves, for with the exception of a
raid made in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1197 by one of the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e21514" title="Source: Ghor&iacute;">Ghori</span> generals this victory secured
Gujar√°t from any serious Muhammadan attack for more than a
century. We learn from various grants made by Bh&iacute;madeva II.
(Ind. Ant VI. 195, 198, 200, 201) that M&uacute;lar√°ja&rsquo;s
regular epithet in the <i>Vam&#803;&#347;√°val&iacute;</i> was
&ldquo;He who overcame in battle the ruler of the Garjjanakas, who are
hard to defeat&rdquo;: and Dr. B&uuml;hler has pointed out (Ditto, 201)
that Garjjanaka is a Sanskritising of the name Ghaznavi. As a matter of
fact, however, the leader of the Musalm√°n army was Muhammad of
Ghor, and the battle took place in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1178 (H. 574). One of the two Muhammadan writers
who mentions the invasion (Muhammad &rsquo;Ufi, who wrote at Delhi
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1211) says that Muhammad was at
first defeated, but invaded the country a second time two years later
&ldquo;and punished the people for their previous misconduct.&rdquo;
But this is only mentioned incidentally as part of an anecdote of
Muhammad&rsquo;s equity, and there is some confusion with
Muhammad&rsquo;s victory in the second battle of N√°r√°yan
(in Jaipur territory) in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1192, as a
better, though slightly later authority, Minh√°j-us-Sir√°j,
speaks of no second expedition to Gujar√°t led by Muhammad
himself. Minh√°j-us-Sir√°j&rsquo;s account of the defeat is
as follows (Elliott, II. 294): He (Muhammad) conducted his army by way
of Uch and Mult√°n towards Nahrw√°l√°. The
R√°&iacute; of Nahrw√°l√°, Bh&iacute;mdeo, was a
minor, but he had a large army and many elephants. In the day of battle
the Muhammadans were defeated and the Sult√°n was compelled to
retreat. This happened in the year 574 H. (1178 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>)&rdquo;. Further on we read (Elliott, II. 300):
&ldquo;In 593 H. (1197 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) he
(Muhammad&rsquo;s general <span class="corr" id="xd25e21536" title="Source: Kutb-ud-din">Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n</span>) went towards
Nahrw√°l√°, defeated R√°&iacute; Bh&iacute;mdeo, and
took revenge on the part of the Sult√°n.&rdquo; As no conquest of
the country is spoken of, this expedition was evidently a mere raid.
The only inaccuracy in the account is the mention of Bh&iacute;ma
instead of M&uacute;lar√°ja as the king who defeated the first
invasion.&mdash;(A. M. T. J.)&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n195.4src">&uarr;</a></p>

were unknown. The ruler of M√°lava invading the kingdom turned
back before the strength of Lava&#7751;apras√°da. The southern
king also when opposed by him gave up the idea of war.&rdquo; The ruler
of M√°lava or M√°lwa referred to was Soha&#7693;a or
Subha&#7789;avarman.<a class="noteref" id="n198.4src" href="#n198.4"

Lava&#7751;apras√°da abdicated in his favour. Probably to

gone to the length of opposing Bh&iacute;madeva by force of arms,
Lava&#7751;apras√°da was careful to rule in his sovereign&rsquo;s
name. Even after Lava&#7751;apras√°da&rsquo;s abdication, though
his famous minister Vastup√°la considered it advisable,
V&iacute;radhavala refused to take the supreme title. It was not until
the accession of V&iacute;radhavala&rsquo;s son V&iacute;saladeva that
the head of the V√°ghel√°s took any higher title than
R√°&#7751;aka or chieftain. Lava&#7751;apras√°da&rsquo;s
religious adviser or Guru was the poet Some&#347;vara the author of the
K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; and of the Vastup√°lacharita or Life
of Vastup√°la, both being biographical accounts of
Vastup√°la. The leading supporters both of
Lava&#7751;apras√°da and of V&iacute;radhavala were their
ministers the two Jain brothers Vastup√°la and
Tejah&#803;p√°la the famous temple-builders on &Aacute;bu,
&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya, and Girn√°r. According to one account
Tejah&#803;p√°la remained at court, while Vastup√°la went
as governor to Stambhat&iacute;rtha or Cambay where he redressed wrongs
and amassed wealth.<a class="noteref" id="n199.2src" href="#n199.2"
name="n199.2src">8</a></p>
<p>One of the chief times of peril in
Lava&#7751;apras√°da&rsquo;s reign was the joint attack of the
Devagiri Y√°dava Singha&#7751;a or Sinha&#7751;a from the south
and of four M√°rw√°r chiefs from the north.
Lava&#7751;apras√°da and his son V&iacute;radhavala in joint
command marched south to meet Singha&#7751;a at Broach. While at Broach
the V√°ghel√°s&rsquo; position was made still more critical
by the desertion of the Godhraha or Godhr√° chief to M√°lwa
and of the L√°&#7789;a or south Gujar√°t chief to
Singha&#7751;a. Still Lava&#7751;apras√°da pressed on, attacked
Singha&#7751;a, and gave him so crushing a defeat, that, though
Lava&#7751;apras√°da had almost at once to turn north to meet the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e21853" title="Source: M√°lw√°">M√°lwa</span> army, Singha&#7751;a
retired without causing further trouble.<a class="noteref" id="n199.3src" href="#n199.3" name="n199.3src">9</a> Some&#347;vara gives
no reason for Singha&#7751;a&rsquo;s withdrawal beyond the remark
&lsquo;Deer do not follow the lion&rsquo;s path even when the lion has
left it.&rsquo; The true reason is supplied by a Manuscript called

Vai&#347;√°kha in the year Sam&#803;vat 1288 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1232). The provisions are that, as before, each
of the belligerents should confine himself to his own territory;
neither of them should invade the possessions of the other; if a
powerful enemy attacked either of them, they should jointly oppose him;
if only a hostile general led the attack, troops should be sent against
him; and if from the country of either any noble fled into the

people of Cambay held a great festival when Vastup√°la passed in

<p>Another of the deeds preserved in the Forms is a royal copperplate
grant by Lava&#7751;apras√°da or
L√°va&#7751;yapras√°da of a village, not named, for the
worship of Soman√°tha. Lava&#7751;apras√°da is described as
the illustrious R√°&#7751;aka,<a class="noteref" id="n200.5src"

Lava&#7751;apras√°da apparently had sufficient influence to make

Bhadre&#347;vara, probably Bhadresar in Kacch, V&iacute;radhavala was
less successful and was forced to accept the Kacch chief&rsquo;s terms.
The chroniclers ascribe this reverse to three R√°jput brothers
who came to V&iacute;radhavala&rsquo;s court and offered their services
for 3,00,000 drammas (about &pound;7500). &ldquo;For 3,00,000 drammas I
can raise a thousand men&rdquo; said V&iacute;radhavala, and the
brothers withdrew. They went to the court of the Bhadresar chief,
stated their terms, and were engaged. The night before the battle the
brothers sent to V&iacute;radhavala saying &lsquo;Keep ready 3000 men,
for through a triple bodyguard we will force our way.&rsquo; The three
brothers kept their word. They forced their way to V&iacute;radhavala,
dismounted him, carried off his favourite steed Uparava&#7789;a, but
since they had been his guests they spared V&iacute;radhavala&rsquo;s
life.<a class="noteref" id="n201.2src" href="#n201.2" name="n201.2src">20</a></p>
<p>Another of V&iacute;radhavala&rsquo;s expeditions was to East
Gujar√°t. Ghughula, chief of Godraha or Godhr√°, plundered
the caravans that passed through his territory to the Gujar√°t
ports. When threatened with punishment by V&iacute;radhavala, Ghughula
in derision sent his overlord a woman&rsquo;s dress and a box of
cosmetics. The minister Tejah&#803;p√°la, who was ordered to
avenge this affront, dispatched some skirmishers ahead to raid the
Godhra cattle. Ghughula attacked the raiders and drove them back in
such panic that the main body of the army was thrown into disorder. The
day was saved by the prowess of Tejah&#803;p√°la who in single
combat unhorsed Ghughula and made him prisoner. Ghughula escaped the
disgrace of the woman&rsquo;s dress and the cosmetic box with which he
was decorated by biting his tongue so that he died. The conquest of
Ghughula is said to have spread V&iacute;radhavala&rsquo;s power to the
borders of Mah√°r√°shtra.<a class="noteref" id="n201.3src"

the Musalm√°ns and the &Aacute;bu troops hung on their rear. The
Musalm√°ns fled in confusion and cartloads of heads were brought
to V&iacute;radhavala in Dholk√°. The chronicles give the credit
of this success to Vastup√°la. They also credit Vastup√°la
with a stratagem which induced the Sult√°n to think well of
V&iacute;radhavala and prevented him taking steps to wipe out the
disgrace of his defeat. Hearing that the Sult√°n&rsquo;s mother,
or, according to another story, the Sult√°n&rsquo;s religious
adviser, was going from Cambay to Makka Vastup√°la ordered his
men to attack and plunder the vessels in which the pilgrimage was to be
made. On the captain&rsquo;s complaint Vastup√°la had the pirates
arrested and the property restored. So grateful was the owner, whether
mother or guide, that Vastup√°la was taken to Delhi and arranged
a friendly treaty between his master and the Sult√°n.<a class="noteref" id="n201.5src" href="#n201.5" name="n201.5src">23</a>

V&iacute;radhavala, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1233&ndash;1238.</span> Their lavish expenditure
on objects connected with Jain worship make the brothers
Vastup√°la and Tejah&#803;p√°la the chief heroes of the
Jain chroniclers. They say when the Musalm√°n trader Sayad was
arrested at Cambay his wealth was confiscated. V&iacute;radhavala
claimed all but the dust which he left to Vastup√°la. Much of the
dust was gold dust and a fire turned to dust more of the Sayad&rsquo;s
gold and silver treasure. In this way the bulk of the Sayad&rsquo;s
wealth passed to Vastup√°la. This wealth Vastup√°la and his
brother Tejah&#803;p√°la went to bury in Had√°laka in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. In digging they chanced to come
across a great and unknown treasure. According to the books the burden
of their wealth so preyed on the brothers that they ceased to care for
food. Finding the cause of her husband Tejah&#803;p√°la&rsquo;s
anxiety Anupam√° said &lsquo;Spend your wealth on a hill top. All
can see it; no one can carry it away.&rsquo; According to the
chroniclers it was this advice, approved by their mother and by
Vastup√°la&rsquo;s wife Lalit√°dev&iacute;, that led the
brothers to adorn the summits of &Aacute;bu, Girn√°r, and
&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya with magnificent temples.</p>
<p>The &#346;atru&ntilde;jaya temple which is dedicated to the
twenty-third T&iacute;rthan&#775;kara Nemin√°tha is dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1232 (Sam&#803;vat 1288) and has an
inscription by Some&#347;vara, the author of the
K&iacute;rtikaumud&iacute; telling how it was built. The Girn√°r
temple, also dedicated to Nemin√°tha, bears date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1232 (Sam&#803;vat 1288). The &Aacute;bu temple,
surpassing the others and almost every building in India in the
richness and delicacy of its carving, is dedicated to Nemin√°tha
and dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1231 (Sam&#803;vat 1287).
Such was the liberality of the brothers that to protect them against
the cold mountain air each of their masons had a fire near him to warm
himself and a hot dinner cooked for him at the close of the day. The
finest carvers were paid in silver equal in weight to the dust
chiselled out of their carvings.<a class="noteref" id="n202.1src" href="#n202.1" name="n202.1src">24</a></p>
<p>The author Some&#347;vara describes how he twice came to the aid of
his friend Vastup√°la. On one occasion he saved Vastup√°la
from a prosecution for peculation. The second occasion was more
serious. Sim&#803;ha the maternal uncle of king V&iacute;saladeva
whipped the servant of a Jain monastery. Enraged at this insult to his
religion Vastup√°la hired a R√°jput who cut off
Sim&#803;ha&rsquo;s offending hand. The crime was proved and
Vastup√°la was sentenced to death. But according to the Jains the
persuasions of Some&#347;vara not only made the king set
Vastup√°la free, but led him to upbraid his uncle for beating the
servant of a Jain monastery. Soon after his release Vastup√°la
was seized with fever. Feeling the fever to be mortal he started for
<span class="corr" id="xd25e22041" title="Source: Satru&ntilde;jaya">&#346;atru&ntilde;jaya</span> but died on
the way. His brother Tejah&#803;p√°la and his son
Jayantap√°la burned his body on the holy hill, and over his ashes
raised a shrine with the name Svarg√°rohanapr√°s√°da

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Musalm√°n Gujar√°t, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1760.</span></span> Muhammadan rule in
Gujar√°t lasted from the conquest of the province by the Dehli
emperor <span class="corr" id="xd25e22496" title="Source: Al√°-ud-din">Al√°-ud-d&iacute;n</span> Khilji
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1295&ndash;1315), shortly before the
close of the thirteenth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, to the
final defeat of the Mughal viceroy <span class="corr" id="xd25e22505"
title="Source: Momin">Mom&iacute;n</span> Kh√°n by the
Mar√°th√°s and the loss of the city of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d at the end of February 1758.</p>
<p>This whole term of Musalm√°n ascendancy, stretching over
slightly more than four and a half centuries, may conveniently be
divided into three parts. The First, the rule of the early sovereigns
of Dehli, lasting a few years more than a century, or, more strictly
from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403; the Second, the rule of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings, a term of nearly a century and
three-quarters, from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403 to
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573; the Third, the rule of the
Mughal Emperors, when, for little less than two hundred years,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573&ndash;1760, Gujar√°t was
administered by viceroys of the court of Dehli.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Territorial Limits.</span>In the course of
these 450 years the limits of Gujar√°t varied greatly. In the
fourteenth century the territory nominally under the control of the
Musalm√°n governors of P√°tan (<span class="corr" id="xd25e22529" title="Source: A&#7751;ahil√°v√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>)
extended southwards from Jh√°lor, about fifty miles north of
Mount Abu, to the neighbourhood of Bombay, and in breadth from the line
of the M√°lwa and Kh√°ndesh hills to the western shores of
peninsular Gujar√°t.<a class="noteref" id="n207.1src" href="#n207.1" name="n207.1src">1</a> The earlier kings of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1450), content with establishing their
power on a firm footing, did not greatly extend the limits of their
kingdom. Afterwards, during the latter part of the fifteenth and the
beginning of the sixteenth centuries (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1450&ndash;1530), the dominions of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings gradually spread till they
included large tracts to the east and north-east formerly in the
possession of the rulers of Kh√°ndesh and M√°lwa. Still
later, during the years of misrule between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1530 and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573,
the west of Kh√°ndesh and the north of the Konkan ceased to form
part of the kingdom of Gujar√°t. Finally, under the arrangements
introduced by the emperor Akbar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, more lands were restored to M√°lwa
and Kh√°ndesh. With the exception of Jh√°lor and Sirohi on
the north, Dungarpur and B√°nsv√°da on the north-east, and

handed to R√°jput√°na and Central India, the limits of
Gujar√°t remain almost as they were laid down by Akbar.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sorath.</span>Though, under the
Musalm√°ns, peninsular Gujar√°t did not bear the name of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, it was then, as at present,
considered part of the province of Gujar√°t. During the early
years of Musalm√°n rule, the peninsula, together with a small
portion of the adjoining mainland, was known as Sorath, a shortened
form of <span class="corr" id="xd25e22584" title="Source: Saur&acirc;shtra">Saur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra</span>, the name
originally applied by the Hindus to a long stretch of sea-coast between
the banks of the Indus and Daman.<a class="noteref" id="n208.1src"
href="#n208.1" name="n208.1src">2</a> Towards the close of the
sixteenth century the official use of the word Sorath was confined to a
portion, though by much the largest part, of the peninsula. At the same
time, the name Sorath seems then, and for long after, to have been
commonly applied to the whole peninsula. For the author of the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, writing as late as the middle of the
eighteenth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1756:
<span class="sc">a.h.</span>&nbsp;1170), speaks of Sorath as divided
into five districts or <i>zill√°hs</i>, H√°l√°r,
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, Gohilv√°&#7693;a,
B√°bri√°v√°&#7693;a, and Jetv√°&#7693;a, and
notices that though Nav√°nagar was considered a separate
district, its tribute was included in the revenue derived from
Sorath.<a class="noteref" id="n208.2src" href="#n208.2" name="n208.2src">3</a> In another passage the same writer thus defines

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Musalm√°n Gujar√°t, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1760.</span></span> The present Sorath
stretches no further than the limits of <span class="corr" id="xd25e22653" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>,
B√°ntwa, and a few smaller holdings.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.</span>The name
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a is of recent origin. It was not
until after the establishment of Musalm√°n power in
Gujar√°t that any portion of the peninsula came to bear the name
of the tribe of K√°this. Even as late as the middle of the
eighteenth century, the name K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a was
applied only to one of the sub-divisions of the peninsula. In the
disorders which prevailed during the latter part of the eighteenth
century, the K√°this made themselves conspicuous. As it was from
the hardy horsemen of this tribe that the tribute-exacting
Mar√°th√°s met with the fiercest resistance, they came to
speak of the whole peninsula as the land of the K√°this. This use
was adopted by the early British officers and has since continued.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Under the kings</span>,
1403&ndash;1573.</span>Under the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings,
as it still is under British rule, Gujar√°t was divided
politically into two main parts; one, called the <i>kh√°lsah</i>
or crown domain administered directly by the central authority; the
other, on payment of tribute in service or in money, left under the
control of its former rulers. The amount of tribute paid by the
different chiefs depended, not on the value of their territory, but on
the terms granted to them when they agreed to become feudatories of the
kings of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Under the Gujar√°t
Sult√°ns this tribute was occasionally collected by military
expeditions headed by the king in person and called
<i>mulkg&iacute;ri</i> or country-seizing circuits.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">States.</span>The internal management of
the feudatory states was unaffected by their payment of tribute.
Justice was administered and the revenue collected in the same way as
under the <span class="corr" id="xd25e22676" title="Source: Anahilapur">A&#7751;ahilapur</span> kings. The revenue
consisted, as before, of a share of the crops received in kind,
supplemented by the levy of special cesses, trade, and transit dues.
The chief&rsquo;s share of the crops differed according to the
locality; it rarely exceeded one-third of the produce, it rarely fell
short of one-sixth. From some parts the chief&rsquo;s share was
realised directly from the cultivator by agents called <i>mantris</i>;
from other parts the collection was through superior
landowners.<a class="noteref" id="n209.1src" href="#n209.1" name="n209.1src">5</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Districts.</span>The
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings divided the portion of their
territory which was under their direct authority into districts or
<i>sark√°rs</i>. These districts were administered in one of two
ways. They were either assigned to nobles in support of a contingent of
troops, or they were set apart as crown domains and managed by paid
officers. The officers placed in charge of districts set apart as
<span class="marginnote">Crown Lands.</span>crown domains were called
<i>mukti&#259;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n209.2src" href="#n209.2"
name="n209.2src">6</a> Their chief duties were to preserve the peace
and to collect the revenue. For the maintenance of order, a body of
soldiers from the army head-quarters at &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
was detached for service in each of these divisions, and placed under
the command of the district governor. At the same time, in addition to
the presence of this detachment of regular troops, every district
contained certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Under the kings</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1573.</span> fortified outposts called
<i>th√°n√°s</i>, varying in number according to the
character of the country and the temper of the people. These posts were
in charge of officers called <i>th√°nad√°rs</i> subordinate
to the district governor. They were garrisoned by bodies of local
soldiery, for whose maintenance, in addition to money payments, a small
assignment of land was set apart in the neighbourhood of the post. On
the arrival of the tribute-collecting army the governors of the
districts through which it passed were expected to join the main body
with their local contingents. At other times the district governors had
little control over the feudatory chiefs in the neighbourhood of their
charge.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Fiscal.</span>For fiscal purposes each
district or <i>sark√°r</i> was distributed among a certain number
of sub-divisions or <i>pargan√°hs</i>, each under a paid official
styled <i>√°mil</i> or <i>tahsild√°r</i>. These
sub-divisional officers realised the state demand, nominally one-half
of the produce, by the help of the headmen of the villages under their
charge. In the sharehold and simple villages of North Gujar√°t
these village headmen were styled <i>patels</i> or according to
Musalm√°n writers <i>mukaddams</i> and in the simple villages of
the south they were known as <i>des√°is</i>. They arranged for
the final distribution of the total demand in joint villages among the
shareholders, and in simple villages from the individual
cultivators.<a class="noteref" id="n210.1src" href="#n210.1" name="n210.1src">7</a> The sub-divisional officer presented a statement of
the accounts of the villages in his sub-division to the district
officer, whose record of the revenue of his whole district was in turn
forwarded to the head revenue officer at court. As a check on the
internal management of his charge, and especially to help him in the
work of collecting the revenue, with each district governor was
associated an accountant. Further that each of these officers might be
the greater check on the other, king &Aacute;hmed I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1412&ndash;1443) enforced the rule that when the
governor was chosen from among the royal slaves the accountant should
be a free man, and that when the accountant was a slave the district
governor should be chosen from some other class. This practise was
maintained till the end of the reign of Muzaffar Sh√°h
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1511&ndash;1525), when, according to
the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, the army became much increased, and the
ministers, condensing the details of revenue, farmed it on contract, so
that many parts formerly yielding one rupee now produced ten, and many
others seven eight or nine, and in no place was there a less increase
than from ten to twenty per cent. Many other changes occurred at the
same time, and the spirit of innovation creeping into the
administration the wholesome system of checking the accounts was given
up and mutiny and confusion spread over Gujar√°t.<a class="noteref" id="n210.2src" href="#n210.2" name="n210.2src">8</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Assigned Lands.</span>The second class of
directly governed districts were the lands assigned to nobles for the
maintenance of contingents of troops. As in other parts of India, it
would seem that at first these assignments were for specified sums
equal to the pay of the contingent. When such assignments were of long
standing, and were large enough to swallow the whole revenue of a
district, it was natural to simplify the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Under the kings</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1573.<br>
Assigned Lands.</span> arrangement by transferring the collection of
the revenue and the whole management of the district to the military
leader of the contingent. So long as the central power was strong,
precautions were doubtless taken to prevent the holder of the grant
from unduly rackrenting his district and appropriating to himself more
than the pay of the troops, or from exercising any powers not vested in
the local governors of districts included within the crown domains. As
in other parts of India, those stipulations were probably enforced by
the appointment of certain civil officers directly from the government
to inspect the whole of the noble&rsquo;s proceedings, as well in
managing his troops as in administering his lands.<a class="noteref"
id="n211.1src" href="#n211.1" name="n211.1src">9</a> The decline of the
king&rsquo;s power freed the nobles from all check or control in the
management of their lands. And when, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1536, the practice of farming was introduced into
the crown domains, it would seem to have been adopted by the military
leaders in their lands, and to have been continued till the annexation
of Gujar√°t by the emperor Akbar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Under the Mughals</span>,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573&ndash;1760.</span>It was the
policy of Akbar rather to improve the existing system than to introduce
a new form of government. After to some extent contracting the limits
of Gujar√°t he constituted it a province or <i>s&ucirc;bah</i> of
the empire, appointing to its <span class="marginnote">Administration.</span>government an officer of the highest
rank with the title of <i>s&ucirc;bahd√°r</i> or viceroy. As was
the case under the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings, the province
continued to be divided into territories managed by feudatory chiefs,
and <span class="marginnote">Crown Lands.</span>districts administered
by officers appointed either by the court of Dehli or by the local
viceroy. The head-quarters of the army remained at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and detachments were told off and
placed under the orders of the officers in charge of the directly
administered divisions. These district governors, as before, belonged
to two classes, paid officers responsible for the management of the
crown domains and military leaders in possession of lands assigned to
them in pay of their contingent of troops. The governors of the crown
domains, who were now known as <i>faujd√°rs</i> or commanders,
had, in addition to the command of the regular troops, the control of
the outposts maintained within the limits of their charge. Like their
predecessors they accompanied the viceroy in his yearly circuit for the
collection of tribute.</p>
<p>As a check on the military governors and to help them in collecting
the revenue, the distinct class of account officers formerly
established by king &Aacute;hmed I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1412&ndash;1443) was again introduced. The head
of this branch of the administration was an officer, second in rank to
the viceroy alone, appointed direct from the court of Dehli with the
title of <i>div√°n</i>. Besides acting as collector-general of
the revenues of the province, this officer was also the head of its
civil administration. His title <i>div√°n</i> is generally
translated minister. And though the word minister does not express the
functions of the office, which corresponded more nearly with those of a
chief secretary, it represents with sufficient accuracy the relation in
which the holder of the office of <i>div√°n</i> generally stood
to the viceroy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"

Revenue Officials.</span> <span class="marginnote">Revenue
Officials.</span>For its revenue administration each district or group
of districts had its revenue officials called <i>am&iacute;ns</i> who
corresponded to the collector of modern times. There were also
<i>am&iacute;ns</i> in the customs department separate from those whose
function was to control and administer the land revenue. Beneath the
<i>am&iacute;n</i> came the <i>√°mil</i><a class="noteref" id="n212.1src" href="#n212.1" name="n212.1src">10</a> who carried on the
actual collection of the land revenue or customs in each district or
<i>pargan√°h</i>, and below the <i>√°mil</i> were the
<i>f√°&icirc;ls</i>, <i>mushrifs</i>, or
<i>k√°rk&uacute;ns</i> that is the revenue clerks. The
<i>√°mil</i> corresponded to the modern
<i>m√°mlatd√°r</i>, both terms meaning him who carries on
the <i>amal</i> or revenue management. In the leading ports the
<i>√°mil</i> of the customs was called <i>mutasaddi</i> that is
civil officer.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Village Officers.</span>The
<i>√°mil</i> or <i>m√°mlatd√°r</i> dealt directly
with the village officials, namely with the <i>mukaddam</i> or headman,
the <i>patw√°ri</i> or lease manager, the
<i>k√°n&uacute;ngo</i> or accountant, and the
<i>hav√°ld√°r</i> or grain-yard guardian. The
<i>hav√°ld√°r</i> superintended the separation of the
government share of the produce; apportioned to the classes subject to
forced labour their respective turns of duty; and exercised a general
police superintendence by means of subordinates called
<i>pas√°it√°s</i> or <i>vartani√°s</i>. In ports
under the <i>mutasaddi</i> was a harbour-master or
<i>sh√°h-bandar</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Des√°is.</span>Crown sub-divisions
had, in addition, the important class called <i>des√°is</i>. The
<i><span class="corr" id="xd25e22963" title="Source: des√°i&rsquo;s">des√°is&rsquo;</span></i> duty
appears at first to have been to collect the <i>sal√°mi</i> or
tribute due by the smaller chiefs, landholders, and
<i>v√°nt√°d√°rs</i> or sharers. For this, in
Akbar&rsquo;s time, the <i>des√°i</i> received a remuneration of
2&frac12; per cent on the sum collected. Under the first viceroy
M&iacute;rza &Aacute;z&iacute;z Kokalt√°sh (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573&ndash;1575) this percentage was reduced to
one-half of its former amount, and in later times this one-half was
again reduced by one-half. Though the Muhammadan historians give no
reason for so sweeping a reduction, the cause seems to have been the
inability of the <i>des√°is</i> to collect the tribute without
the aid of a military force. Under the new system the
<i>des√°i</i> seems merely to have kept the accounts of the
tribute due, and the records both of the amount which should be levied
as tribute and of other customary rights of the crown. In later times
the <i>des√°is</i> were to a great extent superseded by the
district accountants or <i>majmud√°rs</i>, and many
<i>des√°is</i>, especially in south Gujar√°t, seem to have
sunk to <i>patels</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Land Tax.</span>Up to the viceroyalty of
M&iacute;rza <span class="corr" id="xd25e23002" title="Source: &Iacute;s√°">&Iacute;sa</span> Tarkh√°n
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1642&ndash;1644), the land tax
appears to have been levied from the cultivator in a fixed sum, but he
was also subject to numerous other imposts. Land grants in
<i>waz&iacute;fah</i> carried with them an hereditary title and special
exemption from all levies except the land tax. The levy in kind appears
to have ceased before the close of Mughal rule. In place of a levy in
kind each village paid a fixed sum or <i>jama</i> through the district
accountant or <i>majmud√°r</i> who had taken the place of the
<i>des√°i</i>. As in many cases the <i>jama</i> really meant the
lump sum at which the crown villages were assessed and farmed to the
chiefs and <i>patels</i>, on the collapse of the empire many villages
thus farmed to chiefs and landlords were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<p><span class="marginnote">Justice.</span>The administration of
justice seems to have been very complete. In each <i>kasbah</i> or town
<i>k√°zis</i>, endowed with glebe lands in addition to a
permanent salary, adjudicated disputes among Muhammadans according to
the laws of Isl√°m. Disputes between Muhammadans and unbelievers,
or amongst unbelievers, were decided by the department called the
<i>sad√°rat</i>, the local judge being termed a <i>sadr</i>. The
decisions of the local <i>k√°zis</i> and <i>sadrs</i> were
subject to revision by the <i>k√°zi</i> or <i>sadr</i> of the
<i>s&uacute;bah</i> who resided at &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. And
as a last resort the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d decisions were
subject to appeal to the <i>K√°zi-ul-Kuzz√°t</i> and the
<i>Sadr-&ucirc;s-Sud&ucirc;r</i> at the capital.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Fiscal.</span>The revenue appears to have
been classed under four main heads: 1. The
<i>Khaz√°nah-i-&Aacute;mirah</i> or imperial treasury which
comprehended the land tax received from the crown
<i>pargan√°hs</i> or districts, the tribute, the five per cent
customs dues from infidels, the import dues on stuffs, and the
<i>s√°yer</i> or land customs including transit dues, slave
market dues, and miscellaneous taxes. 2. The treasury of arrears into
which were paid government claims in arrear either from the
<i>√°mils</i> or from the farmers of land revenue;
<i>tak√°vi</i> advances due by the <i>raiyats</i>; and tribute
levied by the presence of a military force. 3. The treasury of
charitable endowments. Into this treasury was paid the 2&frac12; per
cent levied as customs dues from Muhammadans.<a class="noteref" id="n213.1src" href="#n213.1" name="n213.1src">11</a> The pay of the
religious classes was defrayed from this treasury. 4. The treasury,
into which the <i>jaziah</i> or capitation tax levied from
<i>zimm&iacute;s</i> or infidels who acknowledged Muhammadan rule, was
paid. The proceeds were expended in charity and public works. After the
death of the emperor Farrukhsiyar (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1713&ndash;1719), this source of revenue was
abolished. The arrangements introduced by Akbar in the end of the
sixteenth century remained in force till the death of Aurangz&iacute;b
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1707. Then trouble and perplexity
daily increased, till in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1724&ndash;25, <span class="corr" id="xd25e23140"
title="Source: Hamid">Ham&iacute;d</span> Kh√°n usurped the
government lands, and, seeking to get rid of the servants and
assignments, gradually obtained possession of the records of the
registry office. The keepers of the records were scattered, and yearly
revenue statements ceased to be received from the districts.<a class="noteref" id="n213.2src" href="#n213.2" name="n213.2src">12</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Assigned Lands.</span>Akbar continued the

Assigned Lands.</span> set aside for the imperial exchequer the
directly governed districts passed into the hands of military leaders
who employed their own agents to collect the revenue. During the
seventeenth century the practice of submitting a yearly record of their
revenues, and the power of the viceroy to bring them to account for
misgovernment, exercised a check on the management of the military
leaders. And during this time a yearly surplus revenue of
&pound;600,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 60,00,000) from the
assigned and crown lands was on an average forwarded from
Gujar√°t to Dehli. In the eighteenth century the decay of the
viceroy&rsquo;s authority was accompanied by the gradually increased
power of the military leaders in possession of assigned districts, till
finally, as in the case of the Naw√°bs of Broach and Surat, they
openly claimed the position of independent rulers.<a class="noteref"

<p><span class="marginnote">Minor Offices.</span>Of both leading and
minor officials the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi supplies the following
additional details. The highest officer who was appointed under the
seal of the minister of the empire was the provincial
<i>div√°n</i> or minister. He had charge of the fiscal affairs of
the province and of the revenues of the <i>kh√°lsa</i> or crown
lands, and was in some matters independent of the viceroy. Besides his
personal salary he had 150 <i>saw√°rs</i> for two provincial
<i>th√°n√°s</i> Arjanpur and Khamb√°lia. Under the
<i>div√°n</i> the chief officers were the
<i>p&iacute;shk√°r div√°n</i> his first assistant, who was
appointed under imperial orders by the patent of the
<i>div√°n</i>, the <i>daroghah</i> or head of the office, and the
<i>sharf</i> or <i>mushrif</i> and <i>tehwild√°r</i> of the
<i>daftar kh√°n√°hs</i>, who presided over the accounts
with <i>munshis</i> and <i>muharrirs</i> or secretaries and writers.
The <i>k√°zis</i>, both town and city, with the sanction of the
emperor were appointed by the chief law officer of the empire through
the chief law officer of the province. They were lodged by the state,
paid partly in cash partly in land, and kept up a certain number of
troopers. In the <i><span class="corr" id="xd25e23246" title="Source: k√°z&iacute;&rsquo;s">k√°zis&rsquo;</span></i>
courts <i>wak&iacute;ls</i> or pleaders and <i>muft&iacute;s</i> or law
officers drew 8 as. to Re. 1 a day. Newly converted Musalm√°ns
also drew 8 as. a day. The city censor or <i>muhtasib</i> had the
supervision of morals and of weights and measures. He was paid in cash
and land, and was expected to keep up sixty troopers. The news-writer,
who was sometimes also <i>bakhshi</i> or military paymaster, had a
large staff of news-writers called
<i>w√°ki&acirc;h-nig√°r</i> who worked in the district
courts and offices as well as in the city courts. He received his
news-reports every evening and embodied them in a letter which was sent
to court by camel post. A second staff of news-writers called
<i>saw√°n&iacute;hnig√°r</i> reported rumours. A third set
were the <i>hark√°r√°s</i> on the viceroy&rsquo;s staff.
Postal <i>chaukis</i> or stations extended from
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d to the Ajm&iacute;r frontier, each with
men and horse ready to carry the imperial post which reached
Sh√°h Jeh√°n√°b√°d or Dehli in seven days. A
line of posts also ran south through Broach to the Dakhan. The
<i>faujd√°rs</i> or military police, who were sometimes
commanders of a thousand and held estates, controlled both the city and
the district police. The <i>kotw√°l</i> or head of the city
night-watch was appointed by the viceroy. He had fifty troopers and a
hundred foot. In the treasury department were the <i>am&iacute;n</i> or

amounted to <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 2000.<a class="noteref" id="n215.1src" href="#n215.1" name="n215.1src">15</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Land Tenures.</span>Besides the class of
vernacular terms that belong to the administration of the province,
certain technical words connected with the tenure of land are of
frequent occurrence in this history. For each of these, in addition to
the English equivalent which as far as possible has been given in the
text, some explanation seems necessary. During the period to which this
history refers, the superior holders of the land of the province
belonged to two main classes, those whose claims dated from before the
Musalm√°n conquest and those whose interest in the land was based
on a Musalm√°n grant. By the Musalm√°n historians,
landholders of the first class, who were all Hindus, are called
<i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i>, while landholders of the second class,
Musalm√°ns as a rule, are spoken of as
<i>j√°g&iacute;rd√°rs</i>. Though the term
<i>zam&iacute;nd√°r</i> was used to include the whole body of
superior Hindu landholders, in practice a marked distinction was drawn
between the almost independent chief, who still enjoyed his Hindu title
of <i>r√°ja</i>, <i>r√°val</i>, <i>r√°v</i>, or
<i>j√°m</i>, and the petty claimant to a share in a government
village, who in a Hindu state would have been known as a
<i>gar√°si√°</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n215.2src" href="#n215.2" name="n215.2src">16</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Hereditary Hindu Landholders.</span>The
larger landholders, who had succeeded in avoiding complete subjection,
were, as noticed above, liable only for the payment of a certain fixed
sum, the collection of which by the central power in later times
usually required the presence of a military force. With regard to the
settlement of the claims of the smaller landholders of the superior
class, whose estates fell within the limits of the directly
administered districts, no steps seem to have been taken till the reign
of &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1411&ndash;1443). About the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1420 the peace of his kingdom was so broken by
agrarian disturbances, that &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h agreed, on
condition of their paying tribute and performing military service, to
re-grant to the landholders of the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°r</i> class
as hereditary possessions a one-fourth share of their former village
lands. The portion so set apart was called <i>v√°nta</i> or
share, and the remainder, retained as state land, was called
<i>talpat</i>. This agreement continued till, in the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1545, during the reign of Mahm&uacute;d
Sh√°h II. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1536&ndash;1553), an
attempt was made to annex these private shares to the crown. This
measure caused much discontent and disorder. It was reversed by the
emperor Akbar who, as part of the settlement of the province in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, restored their one-fourth share
to the landholders, and, except that the Mar√°th√°s

quit-rent from these lands, the arrangements then introduced have since
continued in force.<a class="noteref" id="n216.1src" href="#n216.1"
name="n216.1src">17</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Levies.</span>During the decay of
Musalm√°n rule in Gujar√°t in the first half of the
eighteenth century, shareholders of the <i>gar√°sia</i> class in
government villages, who were always ready to increase their power by
force, levied many irregular exactions from their more peaceful
neighbours, the cultivators or inferior landholders. These levies are
known as <i>vol</i> that is a forced contribution or <i>p√°l</i>
that is protection. All have this peculiar characteristic that they
were paid by the cultivators of crown lands to petty marauders to
purchase immunity from their attacks. They in no case partook of the
nature of dues imposed by a settled government on its own subjects.
<i>Tora gar√°s</i>, more correctly <i>toda gar√°s</i>, is
another levy which had its origin in eighteenth century disorder. It
was usually a readymoney payment taken from villages which, though at
the time crown or <i>kh√°lsa</i>, had formerly belonged to the
<i>gar√°sia</i> who exacted the levy. Besides a readymoney
payment contributions in kind were sometimes exacted.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Service Lands.</span>The second class of
superior landholders were those whose title was based on a
Musalm√°n grant. Such grants were either assignments of large
tracts of land to the viceroy, district-governors, and nobles, to
support the dignity of their position and maintain a contingent of
troops, or they were allotments on a smaller scale granted in reward
for some special service. Land granted with these objects was called
<i>j√°g&iacute;r</i>, and the holder of the land
<i>j√°g&iacute;rd√°r</i>. In theory, on the death of the
original grantee, such possessions were strictly resumable; in practice
they tended to become hereditary. No regular payments were required
from holders of <i>j√°g&iacute;rs</i>. Only under the name of
<i>peshkash</i> occasional contributions were demanded. These
occasional contributions generally consisted of such presents as a
horse, an elephant, or some other article of value. They had more of
the nature of a freewill offering than of an enforced tribute. Under
the Musalm√°ns contributions of this kind were the only payments
exacted from proprietors of the <i>j√°g&iacute;rd√°r</i>
class. But the Mar√°th√°s, in addition to contributions,
imposed on <i>j√°g&iacute;rd√°rs</i> a regular tribute,
similar to that paid by the representatives of the original class of
superior Hindu landholders.</p>
<p>Under Musalm√°n rule great part of Gujar√°t was always
in the hands of <i>j√°g&iacute;rd√°rs</i>. So powerful were
they that on two occasions under the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d

centuries of Musalm√°n ascendancy may serve as an introduction to

1297&ndash;1403.</span>On conquering Gujar√°t in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297 the Musalm√°ns found the country in
disorder. The last kings of A&#7751;ahilapur or P√°tan, suffering
under the defects of an incomplete title, held even their crown lands
with no firmness of grasp, and had allowed the outlying territory to
slip almost entirely from their control. Several of the larger and more
distant rulers had resumed their independence. The Bh&iacute;ls and
Kolis of the hills, forests, and rough river banks were in revolt. And
stranger chiefs, driven south by the Musalm√°n conquests in Upper
India, had robbed the central power of much territory.<a class="noteref" id="n217.3src" href="#n217.3" name="n217.3src">20</a> The
records of the early Musalm√°n governors (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1391) show suspicion on the side of
the Dehli court and disloyalty on the part of more than one viceroy,
much confusion throughout the province, and little in the way of
government beyond the exercise of military force. At the same time, in
spite of wars and rebellions, the country, in parts at least, seems to

<p><span class="marginnote">Under the Kings, 1403&ndash;1573.</span>The
period of the rule of the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1573) contains two
divisions, one lasting from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403 to
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1530, on the whole a time of strong
government and of growing power and prosperity; the other the
forty-three years from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1530 to the
conquest of the province by the emperor Akbar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573, a time of disorder and misrule. In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403 when Gujar√°t separated
from Dehli the new king held but a narrow strip of plain. On the north
were the independent chiefs of Sirohi and Jh√°lor, from whom he
occasionally levied contributions. On the east the R√°ja of
&Iacute;dar, another R√°jput prince, was in possession of the
western skirts of the hills and forests, and the rest of that tract was
held by the mountain tribes of Bhils and Kolis. On the west the
peninsula was in the hands of nine or ten Hindu tribes, probably
tributary, but by no means obedient.<a class="noteref" id="n218.2src"
href="#n218.2" name="n218.2src">22</a> In the midst of so unsettled and
warlike a population, all the efforts of Muzaffar I., the founder of
the dynasty, were spent in establishing his power. It was not until the
reign of his successor &Aacute;hmed I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1412&ndash;1443) that steps were taken to settle
the different classes of the people in positions of permanent order.
About the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1420 two important
measures were introduced. Of these one assigned lands for the support
of the troops, and the other recognised the rights of the superior
class of Hindu landholders to a portion of the village lands they had
formerly held. The effect of these changes was to establish order
throughout the districts directly under the authority of the crown. And
though, in the territories subject to feudatory chiefs, the presence of
an armed force was still required to give effect to the king&rsquo;s
claims for tribute, his increasing power and wealth made efforts at
independence more hopeless, and gradually secured the subjection of the
greater number of his vassals. During the latter part of the fifteenth
and the first quarter of the sixteenth century the power of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings was at its height. At that time
their dominions included twenty-five divisions or
<i>sark√°rs</i>. Among nine of these namely P√°tan,

tribute was received from the rulers of <span class="corr" id="xd25e23690" title="Source: &Aacute;hmednagar">Ahmednagar</span>,
Burh√°npur, Ber√°r, Golkonda, and Bij√°pur, and
customs dues from twenty-five ports on the western coast of India and
from twenty-six foreign marts, some of them in India and others in the
Persian Gulf and along the Arabian coast.<a class="noteref" id="n219.1src" href="#n219.1" name="n219.1src">23</a> The total revenue
from these three sources is said in prosperous times to have amounted
to a yearly sum of &pound;11,460,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>
11,46,00,000). Of this total amount the territorial revenue from the
twenty-five districts yielded &pound;5,840,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 5,84,00,000), or slightly more than one-half. Of
the remaining &pound;5,620,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>

much wealth was at the command of the sovereign and his nobles, while

from the interior districts of the province that the

manufactures and commerce.<a class="noteref" id="n220.1src" href="#n220.1" name="n220.1src">26</a> So it was that along the shores of

of great trade.&rsquo; Among these was Diu, off the south coast of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, yielding so large a revenue to
the king as to be &lsquo;a marvel and amazement.&rsquo; And chief of

Akbar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573 was a time of
confusion. Abroad, the superiority of Gujar√°t over the
neighbouring powers was lost, and the limits of the kingdom shrank; at
home, after the attempted confiscation (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1545) of their shares in village lands the
disaffection of the superior landowners became general, and the court,
beyond the narrow limits of the crown domains, ceased to exercise

or the more turbulent classes. In spite of these forty years of
disorder, the province retained so much of its former prosperity, that
the boast of the local historians that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573 Gujar√°t was in every respect allowed
to be the finest country in Hindust√°n is supported by the
details shortly afterwards (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1590)

P√°tan to Baroda was throughout its length of 150 miles (100
<i>kos</i>) lined on both sides with mango trees; the fields were
bounded with hedges; and such was the abundance of mango and other
fruit trees that the whole country seemed a garden. The people were
well housed in dwellings with walls of brick and mortar and with tiled
roofs; many of them rode in carriages drawn by oxen<span class="corr"

its painters, carvers, inlayers, and other craftsmen.<a class="noteref"

<p><span class="marginnote">Under the Mughals,
1573&ndash;1760.</span>Like the period of the rule of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings, the period of Mughal rule
contains two divisions, a time of good government lasting from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1700, and a time of disorder from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1700 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760.
Under the arrangements introduced by the emperor Akbar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583, the area of the province was considerably
curtailed. Of its twenty-five districts nine were restored to the
states from which the vigour of the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
kings had wrested them; J√°lor and Jodhpur were transferred to
R√°jput√°na; N√°gor to Ajm&iacute;r; Mulher and
Nandurb√°r to Kh√°ndesh; Bombay, Bassein, and Daman were
allowed to remain under the Portuguese; and <span class="corr" id="xd25e23947" title="Source: Danda-R√°j√°puri">Danda-R√°japuri</span>
(Jinjira) was made over to the Niz√°msh√°hi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1490&ndash;1595) rulers of the Dakhan Ahmednagar.
Of the remaining sixteen, Sirohi, Dungarpur, and B√°nsv√°da
now in R√°jput√°na, Kachh, S&ucirc;nth in Rewa
K√°ntha, and R√°mnagar (Dharampur) in Surat were, on the
payment of tribute, allowed to continue in the hands of their Hindu
rulers. The ten remaining districts were administered directly by
imperial officers. But as the revenues of the district of Surat had
been separately assigned to its revenue officer or <i>mutasaddi</i>,
only nine districts with 184 sub-divisions or <i>pargan√°hs</i>
were entered in the collections from the viceroy of Gujar√°t.
These nine districts were in continental Gujar√°t, P√°tan
with seventeen sub-divisions, &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d with
thirty-three, Godhra with eleven, Ch√°mp√°ner with
thirteen, Baroda with four, Broach with fourteen, and R√°jpipla
(N√°ndod) with twelve. In the peninsula were Sorath with
sixty-two and Nav√°nagar with seventeen sub-divisions. This
lessening of area seems to have been accompanied by even more than a
corresponding reduction in the state demand. Instead of
&pound;5,840,050 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 5,84,00,500), the
revenue recovered in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1571, two years

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Condition of Gujar√°t</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1760.<br>
Under the Mughals, 1573&ndash;1760.</span> Besides lightening the state
demand the emperor Akbar introduced three improvements: (1) The survey
of the land; (2) The payment of the headmen or <i>mukaddams</i> of
government villages; and (3) The restoration to small superior
landholders of the share they formerly enjoyed in the lands of
government villages. The survey which was entrusted to R√°ja
Todar Mal, the revenue minister of the empire, was completed in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1575. The operations were confined to
a small portion of the whole area of the province. Besides the six
tributary districts which were unaffected by the measure, Godhra in the
east, the western peninsula, and a large portion of the central strip
of directly governed lands were excluded, so that of the 184
sub-divisions only 64 were surveyed. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1575, of 7,261,849 acres (12,360,594
<i>bigh√°s</i>), the whole area measured, 4,920,818 acres
(8,374,498 <i>bigh√°s</i>) or about two-thirds were found to be
fit for cultivation, and the remainder was waste. In those parts of the
directly governed districts where the land was not measured the
existing method of determining the government share of the produce
either by selecting a portion of the field while the crop was still
standing, or by dividing the grain heap at harvest time, was continued.
In surveyed districts the amount paid was determined by the area and
character of the land under cultivation. Payment was made either in
grain or in money, according to the instructions issued to the
revenue-collectors, &lsquo;that when it would not prove oppressive the
value of the grain should be taken in ready money at the market
price.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n223.1src" href="#n223.1" name="n223.1src">31</a> The chief change in the revenue management was that,
instead of each year calculating the government share from the
character of the crop, an uniform demand was fixed to run for a term of
ten years.</p>
<p>Another important effect of this survey was to extend to cultivators
in simple villages the proprietary interest in the soil formerly
enjoyed only by the shareholders of joint villages. By this change the
power of the military nobles to make undue exactions from the
cultivators in their assigned lands was to some extent checked. It was,
perhaps, also an indirect effect of this more definite settlement of
the crown demand that the revenue agents of government and of the
holders of assigned lands, finding that the revenues could be realised
without their help, refused to allow to the heads of villages certain
revenue dues which, in return for their services, they had hitherto
enjoyed. Accordingly, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1589&ndash;90, these heads of villages appealed
to government and Akbar decided that in assigned districts as well as
in the crown domains from the collections of government lands
two-and-a-half per cent should be set apart as a perquisite for men of
this class.<a class="noteref" id="n223.2src" href="#n223.2" name="n223.2src">32</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"

Under the Mughals, 1573&ndash;1760.</span> When the heads of villages
laid their own private grievance before government, they also brought
to its notice that the Koli and R√°jput landowners, whose shares
in government villages had been resumed by the crown in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1545, had since that time continued in a state of
discontent and revolt and were then causing the ruin of the subjects
and a deficiency in the government collections. An inquiry was
instituted, and, to satisfy the claims of landowners of this class, it
was agreed that, on furnishing good security for their conduct and
receiving the government mark on their contingent of cavalry, they
should again be put in possession of a one-fourth share of the land of
government villages. While the province was managed agreeably to these
regulations, says the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, its
prosperity continued to increase.<a class="noteref" id="n224.1src"

<p>Though these measures did much to check internal disorder,
Gujar√°t, for several years after it came under Mughal control,
continued disturbed by insurrections among the nobles, and so
imperfectly protected from the attacks of foreign enemies that between
the years <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573 and 1609 each of its
three richest cities, &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d Cambay and Surat,
was in turn taken and plundered.<a class="noteref" id="n224.2src" href="#n224.2" name="n224.2src">34</a> During the rest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Condition of Gujar√°t</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1760.<br>
Under the Mughals, 1573&ndash;1760.</span> of the seventeenth century,
though the country was from time to time disturbed by Koli and
R√°jput risings, and towards the end of the century suffered much
from the raids of the Mar√°th√°s, the viceroys were, on the
whole, able to maintain their authority, repressing the outbreaks of
the disorderly classes, and enforcing the imperial claims for tribute
on the more independent feudatory chiefs. Throughout the greater part
of the seventeenth century the general state of the province seems to
have been prosperous. Its cities were the wonder of European
travellers. Surat, which only since the transfer of Gujar√°t to
the Mughal empire had risen to hold a place among its chief centres of
trade, was, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1664, when taken by
Shiv√°ji, rich enough to supply him with plunder in treasure and
precious stones worth a million sterling<a class="noteref" id="n225.1src" href="#n225.1" name="n225.1src">35</a>; and at that time
Cambay is said to have been beyond comparison greater than Surat, and
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d much richer and more populous than
either.<a class="noteref" id="n225.2src" href="#n225.2" name="n225.2src">36</a></p>
<p>From the beginning of the eighteenth century disorder increased.
Unable to rely for support on the imperial court, the viceroys failed
to maintain order among the leading nobles, or to enforce their tribute
from the more powerful feudatories. And while the small Koli and
R√°jput landholders, freed from the control of a strong central
power, were destroying the military posts, taking possession of the
state share of village lands, and levying dues from their more peaceful
neighbours, the burden of the Mar√°tha tribute was year by year
growing heavier. During the last ten years of Musalm√°n rule so
entirely did the viceroy&rsquo;s authority forsake him, that, according
to the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, when the great
landholders refused to pay their tribute, the viceroy had no power to
enforce payment. And so faithless had the great landowners become that
the viceroy could not pass the city gate without an escort.<a class="noteref" id="n225.3src" href="#n225.3" name="n225.3src">37</a>

Introduction.<br>
<span class="sc">Condition of Gujar√°t</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1297&ndash;1760.<br>
Self-governed Zam&iacute;nd√°rs.</span> The above summary
contains frequent references to three classes of
zam&iacute;nd√°rs: (1) The <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of the
self-governed states; (2) The greater <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of
the crown districts; and (3) The lesser <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i>
of the crown districts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Self-governed
Zam&iacute;nd√°rs.</span>In the case of the
<i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of self-governed states the principle
was military service and no tribute. The author of the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi says that finally the
<i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of the self-governed states ceased to do
service. In spite of this statement it seems probable that some of this
class served almost until the complete collapse of the empire, and that
tribute was rarely levied from them by an armed force. In the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi account of the office of
<i>s&uacute;bahd√°r</i> or <i>n√°zim s&ucirc;bah</i> the
following passage occurs: When occasion arose the <i>n√°zims</i>
used to take with their armies the contingents of the
R√°n√°s of Udepur D&uacute;ngarpur and
B√°nsv√°da, which were always permanently posted outside
their official residences (in &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d). This
shows that these great <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> had official
residences at the capital, where probably their contingents were posted
under <i>wak&iacute;ls</i> or agents. It therefore seems probable that
their tribute too would be paid through their representatives at the
capital and that a military force was seldom sent against them.
Accordingly notices of military expeditions in the tributary
<i>sark√°rs</i> are rare though they were of constant occurrence
in the crown districts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Crown Zam&iacute;nd√°rs.</span>The
position of the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of the
<i>kh√°lsa</i> or crown districts was very different from that of
the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of self-governed territories. The
<i>kh√°lsa zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> had been deprived of the
greater portion of their ancestral estates which were administered by
the viceregal revenue establishment. In some instances their capitals
had been annexed. Even if not annexed the capital was the seat of
<i>faujd√°r</i> who possessed the authority and encroached daily
on the rights and privileges of the chieftain. The principal chiefs in
this position were those of R√°jp&iacute;pla and &Iacute;dar in
Gujar√°t and the J√°m of Nav√°nagar in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. Of the three, R√°jpipla
had been deprived of his capital N√°ndod and of all the fertile
districts, and was reduced to a barren sovereignty over
rocks<span class="corr" id="xd25e24361" title="Not in source">,</span>
hills and Bh&iacute;ls at R√°jp&iacute;pla. &Iacute;dar had
suffered similar treatment and the capital was the seat of a Muhammadan
<i>faujd√°r</i>. Nav√°nagar, which had hitherto been a
tributary <i>sark√°r</i>, was during the reign of
Aurangz&iacute;b made a crown district. But after
Aurangz&iacute;b&rsquo;s death the J√°m returned to his capital
and again resumed his tributary relations.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Smaller Zam&iacute;nd√°rs.</span>The
lesser holders, including <i>gr√°si√°s
w√°nt√°d√°rs</i> and others, had suffered similar
deprivation of lands and were subject to much encroachment from the
government officials. Throughout the empire widespread discontent
prevailed among subordinate holders of this description as well as
among all the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> of the crown districts, so
that the successes of Shiv√°ji in the Dakhan found ardent
sympathisers even in Gujar√°t. When the
<i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> saw that this Hindu rebel was strong
enough to pillage Surat they began to hope that a day of deliverance
was near. The death of Aurangz&iacute;b (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1707) was the signal for these restless spirits
to bestir themselves. When the Mar√°th√°s began regular
inroads they were hailed as deliverers from the yoke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>

Smaller Zam&iacute;nd√°rs.</span> of the Mughal. The
R√°jp&iacute;pla chief afforded them shelter and a passage
through his country. The encouragement to anarchy given by some of the
R√°jput viceroys who were anxious to emancipate themselves from
the central control further enabled many chieftains
<i>gir√°si√°s</i> and others to absorb large portions of
the crown domains, and even to recover their ancient capitals. Finally
disaffected Muhammadan <i>faujd√°rs</i> succeeded in building up
estates out of the possessions of the crown and founding the families
which most of the present Muhammadan chieftains of Gujar√°t
represent.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha Ascendancy,
1760&ndash;1802.</span>When the imperial power had been usurped by the
Mar√°tha leaders, the chiefs who had just shaken off the more
powerful Mughal yoke were by no means disposed tamely to submit to
Mar√°tha domination. Every chief resisted the levy of tribute and
<span class="corr" id="xd25e24415" title="Source: Momin">Mom&iacute;n</span> Kh√°n reconquered
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In this struggle the
Mar√°th√°s laboured under the disadvantage of dissensions
between the Peshwa and the G√°ikw√°r. They were also
unaware of the actual extent of the old imperial domain and were
ignorant of the amount of tribute formerly levied. They found that the
<i>faujd√°rs</i>, who, in return for Mar√°tha aid in
enabling them to absorb the crown <i>pargan√°hs</i>, had agreed
to pay tribute, now joined the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> in
resisting Mar√°tha demands, while with few exceptions the
<i>des√°is</i> and <i>majmud√°rs</i> either openly allied
themselves with the <i>zam&iacute;nd√°rs</i> or were by force or
fraud deprived of their records. <span class="marginnote">G√°ikw√°r Saved by British Alliance,
1802.</span>So serious were the obstacles to the collection of the
Mar√°tha tribute that, had it not been for the British alliance
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1802, there seems little doubt
that the G√°ikw√°r would have been unable to enforce his
demands in his more distant possessions. The British alliance checked
the disintegration of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s power, and the
permanent settlement of the tribute early in this century enabled that
chief to collect a large revenue at a comparatively trifling cost. Not
only were rebels like Malh√°rr√°o and K√°noji
suppressed, but powerful servants like Vithalr√°v Dev√°ji,
who without doubt would have asserted their independence, were
confirmed in their allegiance and the rich possessions they had
acquired became part of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s
dominions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Power of Chiefs.</span>It must not be
supposed that while the larger chiefs were busy absorbing whole
<i>pargan√°hs</i> the lesser chiefs were more backward. They too
annexed villages and even Mughal posts or <i>th√°n√°hs</i>,
while <i>w√°nt√°d√°rs</i> or sharers absorbed the
<i>talpat</i> or state portion, and, under the name of <i>tora
gar√°s</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n227.1src" href="#n227.1" name="n227.1src">38</a> daring spirits imposed certain rights over crown
villages once their ancient possessions, or, under the name of
<i>p√°l</i> or <i>vol</i>, enforced from neighbouring villages
payments to secure immunity from pillage. Even in the Baroda district
of the thirteen Mughal posts only ten now belong to the
G√°ikw√°r, two having been conquered by
<i>gir√°si√°s</i> and one having fallen under Broach. In

themselves independent of Dehli. It was thus that the
Sult√°n&rsquo;s territories became divided among the nobles,
whose dissensions reduced the province to Akbar&rsquo;s authority. It
was thus that the chiefs and local governors, conniving at
Mar√°tha inroads, subverted Mughal rule. Finally it was thus that
the G√°ikw√°r lost his hold of his possessions and was
rescued from ruin solely by the power of the British. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>

href="#n217.2src" name="n217.2">19</a></span> According to the European
travellers in India during the seventeenth century, provincial
governors, and probably to some extent all large holders of service
lands, employed various methods for adding to the profits which the
assigned lands were meant to yield them. Of these devices two seem to
have been specially common, the practice of supporting a body of horse
smaller than the number agreed for, and the practice of purveyance that
is of levying supplies without payment. Sir Thomas Roe, from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1615 to 1618 English ambassador at
the court of the emperor Jeh√°ng&iacute;r, gives the following
details of these irregular practices: &lsquo;The P√°tan (that is
Patna in Bengal) viceroy&rsquo;s government was estimated at 5000
horse, the yearly pay of each trooper being &pound;20 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 200), of which he kept only 1500, being allowed the
surplus as dead pay. On one occasion this governor wished to present me
with 100 loaves of the finest sugar, as white as snow, each loaf
weighing fifty pounds. On my declining, he said, &lsquo;You refuse
these loaves, thinking I am poor; but being made in my government the
sugar costs me nothing, as it comes to me gratis.&rsquo; Sir Thomas Roe
in Kerr&rsquo;s Voyages, IX. 282&ndash;284. The same writer, the best
qualified of the English travellers of that time to form a correct
opinion, thus describes the administration of the Musalm√°n
governors of the seventeenth century: &lsquo;They practise every kind
of tyranny against the natives under their jurisdiction, oppressing
them with continual exactions, and are exceedingly averse from any way
being opened by which the king may be informed of their infamous
proceedings. They grind the people under their government to extract
money from them, often hanging men up by the heels to make them confess
that they are rich, or to ransom themselves from faults merely imputed
with a view to fleece them.&rsquo; Sir Thomas Roe in Kerr&rsquo;s

Bird 109, is: &lsquo;A sum of 25 <i>l√°khs</i> of
<i>h&uacute;ns</i> and one <i>kror</i> of
<i>ibr√°h&iacute;ms</i>, that were two parts greater, being
altogether nearly equal to 5 <i>krors</i> and 62 <i>l√°khs</i> of
rupees, was collected from the Dakhan tribute and the customs of the
European and Arab ports.&rsquo; The word <i>h&uacute;n</i>, from an old
Karn√°tak word for gold, is the Musalm√°n name for the coin
known among Hindus as <i>var√°ha</i> or the wild-boar coin, and
among the Portuguese as the <i>pagoda</i> or temple coin. Prinsep
<abbr title="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> Thomas&rsquo; Ed. II.
U. T. 18. The old specimens of this coin weigh either 60 grains the
<i>m√°da</i> or half pagoda, or 120 grains the <i>h&uacute;n</i>
or full pagoda. Thomas, Chron. Pat. Ks. II. 224, note. The star pagoda,
in which English accounts at Madras were formerly kept, weighs
52&middot;56 grains, and was commonly valued at 8s. or <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 4 (Prinsep as above). At this rate in the present
sum the 25 <i>l√°khs</i> of <i>h&uacute;ns</i> would equal one
<i>kror</i> (100 <i>l√°khs</i>) of rupees. The
<i>ibr√°h&iacute;mi</i>, &lsquo;two parts greater than the
<i>h&uacute;n</i>,&rsquo; would seem to be a gold coin, perhaps a
variety of the Persian <i>ashrafi</i> (worth about 9s. English.
Marsden, N. O. 455). Taking the two parts of a <i>h&uacute;n</i> as
<i>f√°nams</i> or sixteenths, this would give the
<i>ibr√°h&iacute;mi</i> a value of <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 4&frac14;, and make a total customs revenue of 425
<i>l√°khs</i> of rupees. This statement of the revenues of the
kingdom is, according to the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi,
taken from such times as the power of the Gujar√°t kings
continued to increase. The total revenue of the twenty-five districts
(&pound;5,840,000) is the amount recovered in the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1571. But the receipts under the head of Tribute
must have been compiled from accounts of earlier years. For, as will be
seen below, the neighbouring kings ceased to pay tribute after the end
of the reign of Bah√°dur (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1536). Similarly the customs revenues entered as
received from Daman and other places must have been taken from the
accounts of some year previous to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1560.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n219.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

(&Aacute;in-i-Akbari: Gladwin, II. 64.) The Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi
makes no special reference to the sovereign&rsquo;s share of the
revenue. The greater part of the &pound;5,620,000 derived from tribute
and customs would probably go to the king, besides the lands specially
set apart as crown domains, which in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1571 were returned as yielding a yearly revenue
of &pound;900,000 (900,000,000 <i>tank√°s</i>). This would bring

ports mentioned by Barbosa are: On the south coast of the peninsula,
two: Patenixi (P√°tan-Somn√°th, now Ver√°val), very
rich and of great trade; Surati-Mangalor (Mangrul), a town of commerce,
and Diu. On the shores of the gulf of Cambay four: Gogari (Gogha), a
large town; Barbesy (Broach); Guand√°ri or Gandar
(Gandh√°r), a very good town; and Cambay. On the western coast
five: Ravel (R√°nder), a rich place; Surat, a city of very great
trade; Denvy (Gandevi), a place of great trade; Baxay (Bassein), a good
seaport in which much goods are exchanged; and Tanamayambu
(Th√°na-M√°him), a town of great Moorish mosques, but of
little trade. (Stanley&rsquo;s Barbosa, 59&ndash;68). The only one of
these ports whose identification seems doubtful is Ravel, described by
Barbosa (page 67) as a pretty town of the Moors on a good river, twenty
leagues south of Gandh√°r. This agrees with the position of
R√°nder on the T√°pti, nearly opposite Surat, which appears
in Al B&iacute;r&uacute;ni (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1030) as
R√°hanur one of the capitals of south Gujar√°t and is
mentioned under the name R√°nir, both in the <span class="corr"

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1590) and in the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi for the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1571, as a place of trade, &lsquo;in ancient
times a great city.&rsquo; In his description of the wealth of Cambay,
Barbosa is supported by the other European travellers of the fifteenth
and early sixteenth centuries. According to Nicolo de Conti
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1420&ndash;1444), the town,
including its suburbs, was twelve miles in circuit abounding in
spikenard, lac, indigo, myrobalans, and silk. Athanasius Nikotin
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1468&ndash;1474) found it a
manufacturing place for every sort of goods as long gowns damasks and
blankets; and Varthema (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1503&ndash;1508) says it abounds in grain and
very good fruits, supplying Africa Arabia and India with silk and
cotton stuffs; <span class="corr" id="xd25e23877" title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>it is impossible to describe its
excellence.&rsquo; Barbosa&rsquo;s account of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d is borne out by the statement in the
&Aacute;in-i-Akbari (Gladwin, II. 63) that the whole number of the
suburbs (<i>pur√°s</i>) of the city was 360, and in the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, that it once contained 380 suburbs each of
considerable size, containing good buildings and markets filled with
everything valuable and rare, so that each was almost a city. Bird,

Mughal collections from Gujar√°t compared with the revenues of
the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings may have been due to
Akbar&rsquo;s moderation. It may also have been due to a decline in
prosperity. Compare Roe&rsquo;s (1617) account of Toda about fifty
miles south-east of Ajm&iacute;r. It was the best and most populous
country Roe had seen in India. The district was level with fertile soil
abounding in corn cotton and cattle and the villages were so numerous
and near together as hardly to exceed a <i>kos</i> from each other. The
town was the best built Roe had seen in India tiled two-storied houses
good enough for decent shopkeepers. It had been the residence of a
R√°jput R√°ja before the conquests of Akbar Sh√°h and
stood at the foot of a good and strong rock about which were many
excellent works of hewn stone, well cut, with many tanks arched over
with well-turned vaults and large and deep descents to them. Near it
was a beautiful grove two miles long and a quarter of a mile broad all
planted with mangoes tamarinds and other fruit trees, divided by shady
walks and interspersed with little temples and idol altars with many
fountains wells and summer houses of carved stone curiously arched so
that a poor banished Englishman might have been content to dwell there.
This observation may serve universally for the whole country that ruin
and devastation operate everywhere. For since the property of all has
become vested in the king no person takes care of anything so that in
every place the spoil and devastations of war appear and nowhere is
anything repaired. Roe in Kerr&rsquo;s Voyages, IX.

gives a grand total of &pound;2,644,878. According to a statement given

other districts south of the M√°hi were returned in

&#8532;rds of a rupee to slightly less than &frac12;; the revenues from
R√°dhanpur and Morvi were entered in <i>mahm&uacute;dis</i>, a
coin nearly identical in value with the <i>chang&iacute;zi</i>, while,
as noticed above, the tribute and customs dues are returned in a gold
currency, the tribute in <i>huns</i> of about 8s. (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 4) and the customs in

(Gladwin), I. 305. The &Aacute;in-i-Akbari mentions four ways of
calculating the state share in an unsurveyed field: (1) to measure the
land with the crops standing and make an estimate; (2) to reap the
crops, collect the grain in barns, and divide it according to
agreement; (3) to divide the field as soon as the seed is sown; and (4)
to gather the grain into heaps on the field and divide it

2&frac12; per cent was granted are referred to in the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi as <i>des√°is</i>. Whatever doubt may
attach to the precise meaning of the term <i>des√°i</i> it seems
clear that it was as village headmen that the <i>des√°is</i>
petitioned for and received this grant. These <i>des√°is</i> were
the heads of villages with whom, as noticed above, the government agent
for collecting the revenue dealt, and who, agreeing for the whole
village contribution, themselves carried out the details of allotment
and collection from the individual cultivators. In the sharehold
villages north of the Narbada, the headman who would be entitled to
this 2&frac12; per cent was the representative of the body of village
shareholders. South of the Narbada, in villages originally colonised by
officers of the state, the representatives of these officers would
enjoy the 2&frac12; per cent. In south Gujar√°t the
<i>des√°is</i> or heads of villages also acted as district
hereditary revenue officers; but it was not as district hereditary
revenue officers, but as heads of villages, that they received from
Akbar this 2&frac12; per cent assignment. In north Gujar√°t there
were <i>des√°is</i> who were only district revenue officers.
These men would seem to have received no part of Akbar&rsquo;s grant in
1589&ndash;90, for as late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1706
the emperor Aurangz&iacute;b, having occasion to make inquiries into
the position of the <i>des√°is</i>, found that hitherto they had
been supported by cesses and illegal exactions, and ordered that a stop
should be put to all such exactions, and a fixed assignment of
2&frac12; per cent on the revenues of the villages under their charge
should be allowed them. It does not appear whether the Surat
<i>des√°is</i> succeeded in obtaining Aurangz&iacute;b&rsquo;s
grant of 2&frac12; per cent as district revenue officers in addition to
Akbar&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1589) assignment of
2&frac12; per cent as heads of villages.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n223.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

famous general of the king of <span class="corr" id="xd25e24222" title="Source: &Aacute;hmednagar">Amednagar</span>. In such unsettled times
it is not surprising that the European travellers of the late sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries, between &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
and Cambay found native merchants marching in large weekly caravans
which rested at night within a space barricaded by carts. (Kerr, IX.
127 and 201.) The English merchants, on their way from one factory to
another, were accompanied by an escort, and, in spite of their guard,
were on more than one occasion attacked by large bands of
R√°jputs. (Kerr, IX. 127, 187, 201, 203.) As regards the state of
the different parts of the province, Nicholas Ufflet, who went from
Agra to Surat about 1610, describes the north, from Jh√°lor to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, as throughout the whole way a sandy and
woody country, full of thievish beastly men, and savage beasts such as
lions and tigers; from &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d to Cambay the
road was through sands and woods much infested by thieves; from Cambay
to Broach it was a woody and dangerous journey; but from Broach to
Surat the country was goodly, fertile, and full of villages, abounding
in wild date trees. (Kerr, VIII. 303.) Passing from the mouth of the
T√°pti to Surat Mr. Copland (24th Dec. 1613) was delighted to see
at the same time the goodliest spring and harvest he had ever seen.
&lsquo;Often of two adjoining fields, one was as green as a fine
meadow, and the other waving yellow like gold and ready to be cut down,
and all along the roads were many goodly villages.&rsquo; (Kerr, IX.
119.) At that time the state of north-east Gujar√°t was very
different. Terry, 1617 (Voyage, 404), describes the passage of nineteen
days from M√°ndu near Dh√°r to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d as short journeys in a wilderness where
a way had to be cut and made even and the great space required for the
Mughal&rsquo;s camp rid and made plain by grubbing up trees and bushes.
And between Cambay and &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d De la Valle,

since the insecurity of the ways did not allow him to go alone. Still
at that time Gujar√°t as a whole (see above page <a href="#n220.2">220 note 2</a>) was an exceeding rich province, a description
which twenty years later (1638) is borne out by Mandelslo (Travels,
French Edition, 56): No province in India is more fertile; none yields
more fruit or victuals. With the boast of the author of the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1756)
that Gujar√°t was the richest province in India compare
Kh√°fi Khan&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1719)

in India can equal.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n224.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

great that if he had not seen it he would not have believed it possible
(C&aelig;sar Frederick); 1623, indifferent large with sufficiently
spacious suburbs and a great concourse of vessels (De la Valle,

comparison larger than Surat (Mandelslo, 101&ndash;108);
1663&ndash;1671, twice as big as Surat (Bald&aelig;us in Churchill,
III. 506). &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, 1598, a very great city and
populous (C&aelig;sar Frederick); 1623, competently large with great
suburbs, a goodly and great city, with large fair and straight but
sadly dusty streets (De la Valle, <span class="corr" id="xd25e24276"
title="Source: Haklyt">Hakluyt</span> Edition, I. 95); 1627, large and
beautiful with many broad and comely streets, a rich and uniform
baz√°r, and shops redundant with gums perfumes spices silks
cottons and calicoes (Herbert&rsquo;s Travels, 3rd Edition, 66); 1638,
great manufactures, satin and velvet, silk and cotton (Mandelslo, 80);

who was afterwards ennobled by the title of T√°j or Sadr-ul-Mulk.
Khusraw Kh√°n Parm√°r was then appointed governor, but it

1325&ndash;1351.</span>Sult√°n Muhammad Tughlak, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1325&ndash;1351. Subsequently the same emperor
granted the government of Gujar√°t to &Aacute;hmad Ay√°z,
Malik Mukbil continuing to act as his deputy. Afterwards when
&Aacute;hmad Ay√°z, who received the title of Khw√°jah
Jah√°n, proceeded as governor to Gujar√°t, Malik Mukbil
acted as his minister. And about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1338, when Khw√°jah Jah√°n was sent

of Kampila<a class="noteref" id="n230.2src" href="#n230.2" name="n230.2src">8</a> who had sheltered him, Malik Mukbil succeeded to the
post of governor. On one occasion between Baroda and Dabhoi Malik
Mukbil, who was escorting treasure and a caravan of merchants to Dehli,
was plundered by some bands of the Am&iacute;r√°ni Sadah or
Captains of Hundreds freelances and freebooters, most of them New
Musalm√°ns or Mughal converts, and the rest Turk and
Afgh√°n adventurers. This success emboldened these banditti and
for several years they caused loss and confusion in Gujar√°t. At
last, about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1346, being joined by
certain Muhammadan nobles and Hindu chieftains, they broke into open
rebellion and defeated one &Aacute;z&iacute;z, who was appointed by the
emperor to march against them. <span class="marginnote">The Emperor

the same campaign he drove the Gohil chief Mokher√°ji out of his
stronghold on Piram Island near Gogha on the Gulf of Cambay, and then,
landing his forces, after a stubborn conflict, defeated the Gohils,
killing Mokher√°ji and capturing Gogha. Afterwards Muhammad

Cambay, and afterwards laid siege to Broach. Muhammad Tughlak at once
marched for Gujar√°t and relieved Broach, Malik

hosts learned who the stranger was, they gave him their sister in
marriage and followed his fortunes. Afterwards F&iacute;r&uacute;z
persuading them to embrace Isl√°m, conferred on Sah√°ran
the title of <span class="corr" id="xd25e24805" title="Source: Wajih-ul-Mulk">Waj&iacute;h-ul-Mulk</span>, and on
S√°dhu the title of Shamsh&iacute;r Kh√°n. Finally, in

Chapter II.<br>
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d Kings, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1573.</span> The rule of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d kings extends over 170 years and
includes the names of fifteen sovereigns. The period may conveniently
be divided into two parts. The first, lasting for a little more than a
century and a quarter, when, under strong rulers, Gujar√°t rose
to consequence among the kingdoms of Western India; the second, from
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1536 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1573, an evil time when the sovereigns were
minors and the wealth and supremacy of Gujar√°t were wasted by
the rivalry of its nobles.</p>
<p>The date on which Zafar Kh√°n openly threw off his allegiance
to Dehli is doubtful. Farishtah says he had the Friday prayer or
<i>khutbah</i> repeated in his name after his successful campaign
against Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a and Delv√°&#7693;a
in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1396. According to the
Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari he maintained a nominal allegiance till
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403 when he formally invested his
son T√°t√°r Kh√°n with the sovereignty of
Gujar√°t, under the title of N√°sir-ud-d&iacute;n Muhammad
Sh√°h.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Muhammad I. 1403&ndash;1404.</span>On
ascending the throne in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403,
Muhammad Sh√°h made As√°wal his capital, and, after
humbling the chief of N√°ndo&#7693; or N√°dot in
R√°jpipla, marched against Dehli by way of P√°tan. On his
way to P√°tan the king sickened and died. His body was brought
back to P√°tan, and the expedition against Dehli came to nothing.
It seems probable that this is a courtly version of the tale; the fact
being that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403
T√°t√°r Kh√°n imprisoned his father at As√°wal,
and assumed the title of Muhammad Sh√°h, and that
T√°t√°r Kh√°n&rsquo;s death was caused by poison
administered in the interest, if not at the suggestion, of his father
Zafar Kh√°n.<a class="noteref" id="n234.1src" href="#n234.1"

<p><span class="marginnote">Zafar Kh√°n reigns as Muzaffar,

Kh√°n asked his own younger brother Shams Kh√°n
Dand√°ni to carry on the government, but he refused. Zafar
Kh√°n accordingly sent Shams Kh√°n Dand√°ni to
N√°gor in place of Jal√°l Kh√°n Khokhar, and in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1407&ndash;8, at B&iacute;rpur, at
the request of the nobles and chief men of the country, himself
formally mounted the throne and assumed the title of Muzaffar
Sh√°h. At this time &Aacute;lp Kh√°n, son of Dil√°war
Kh√°n of M√°lwa, was rumoured to have poisoned his father
and ascended the throne with the title of Sult√°n Hushang Ghori.

the charge of his brother Shams Kh√°n, on whom he conferred the
title of Nasrat Kh√°n. Hushang remained a year in confinement,
and M&uacute;sa Kh√°n one of his relations usurped his authority.
On hearing this, Hushang begged to be released, and Muzaffar
Sh√°h not only agreed to his prayer, but sent his grandson
&Aacute;hmed Kh√°n with an army to reinstate him. This expedition
was successful; the fortress of M√°ndu was taken and the usurper
M&uacute;sa Kh√°n was put to flight. &Aacute;hmed Kh√°n
returned to Gujar√°t in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1409&ndash;10. Meanwhile Muzaffar advancing
towards Dehli to aid Sult√°n Mahm&uacute;d (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1393&ndash;1413), prevented an intended attack on
that city by Sult√°n Ibr√°h&iacute;m of <span class="corr"

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1410&ndash;11), to quell a rising
among the Kolis near As√°val, Muzaffar placed his grandson
&Aacute;hmed Kh√°n in command of an army. &Aacute;hmed
Kh√°n camped outside of P√°tan. He convened an assembly of
learned men and asked them whether a son was not bound to exact
retribution from his father&rsquo;s murderer. The assembly stated in
writing that a son was bound to exact retribution. Armed with this
decision, &Aacute;hmed suddenly entered the city, overpowered his
grandfather, and forced him to drink poison. The old Kh√°n said:
&lsquo;Why so hasty, my boy. A little patience and power would have
come to you of itself.&rsquo; He advised &Aacute;hmed to kill the evil
counsellors of murder and to drink no wine. Remorse so embittered
&Aacute;hmed&rsquo;s after-life that he was never known to laugh.</p>

his cousin Moid-ud-d&iacute;n F&iacute;r&uacute;z Kh√°n, governor
of Baroda, allying himself with His√°m or Niz√°m-ul-Mulk
Bhand√°ri and other nobles, collected an army at
Na&#7693;i√°d in Kaira, and, laying claim to the crown, defeated
the king&rsquo;s followers. J&iacute;vand√°s, one of the
insurgents, proposed to march upon P√°tan, but as the others
refused a dispute arose in which J&iacute;vand√°s was slain, and
the rest sought and obtained &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h&rsquo;s
forgiveness. Moid-ud-d&iacute;n F&iacute;r&uacute;z Kh√°n went to
Cambay and was there joined by Masti Kh√°n, son of Muzaffar
Sh√°h, who was governor of Surat: on the king&rsquo;s advance
they fled from Cambay to Broach, to which fort &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h
laid siege. As soon as the king arrived, Moid-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s
army went over to the king, and Masti Kh√°n also submitted. After

when his country was threatened, the chief could retire to his hills,
where he could not easily be followed. As a permanent check on his
movements, &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1427, built the fort of Ahmednagar,<a class="noteref" id="n238.4src" href="#n238.4" name="n238.4src">17</a> on the
banks of the H√°thmati, eighteen miles south-west of &Iacute;dar.

He was pursued into the hills and brought to bay in a narrow pathway at
the edge of a steep ravine. P&uacute;nja was driving back his pursuers

from foreign conquests, devoting himself to improving his dominions and
to working out a system of paying his troops. The method he finally
adopted was payment half in money and half in land. This arrangement
attached the men to the country, and, while keeping them dependent on
the state, enabled them to be free from debt. Further to keep his
officials in check he arranged that the treasurer should be one of the
king&rsquo;s slaves while the actual paymaster was a native of the
particular locality. He also appointed <i>√°mils</i> that is
sub-divisional revenue officers. After R√°v P&uacute;nja&rsquo;s

&Aacute;hmed&rsquo;s justice two instances are recorded. Sitting in the
window of his palace watching the S√°barmati in flood
&Aacute;hmed saw a large earthen jar float by. The jar was opened and
the body of a murdered man was found wrapped in a blanket. The potters
were called and one said the jar was his and had been sold to the
headman of a neighbouring village. On inquiry the headman was proved to
have murdered a grain merchant and was hanged. The second case was the
murder of a poor man by &Aacute;hmed&rsquo;s son-in-law. The
K√°zi found the relations of the deceased willing to accept a
blood fine and when the fine was paid released the prince. &Aacute;hmed
hearing of his son-in-law&rsquo;s release said in the case of the rich
fine is no punishment and ordered his son-in-law to be hanged.<a class="noteref" id="n240.1src" href="#n240.1" name="n240.1src">23</a></p>

Sult√°n Mahm&uacute;d, marching to S√°rsa-P√°lri,

Na&#7693;i√°d, whose Br√°hmans astonished him by their

after a doubtful fight of some hours, he defeated Sult√°n
Mahm&uacute;d, though during the battle that prince was able to
penetrate to Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s camp and carry off his crown
and jewelled girdle. The Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari ascribes
Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s victory in great measure to the gallantry of
certain inhabitants of Dholka<a class="noteref" id="n241.3src" href="#n241.3" name="n241.3src">27</a> called Darw√°ziyahs. Muzaffar
Kh√°n, who is said to have incited the M√°lwa Sult√°n
to invade Gujar√°t, was captured and beheaded, and his head was
hung up at the gate of Kapadvanj. On his return from Kapadvanj
Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n built the magnificent Hauzi Kutb or K√°nkariya
Tank about a mile to the south of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
According to the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 50&ndash;57)
this war between M√°lwa and Gujar√°t was controlled by the
spiritual power of certain holy teachers. The war was brought on by the
prayers of Sheikh Kam√°l M√°lwi, whose shrine is in
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d behind Khud√°wand
Kh√°n&rsquo;s mosque near <span class="corr" id="xd25e25420"
title="Source: Sh√°h-i-Alam&rsquo;s">Sh√°h-i-&Aacute;lam&rsquo;s</span>
tomb, who favoured M√°lwa. Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s cause was
aided by the blessing of Kutbi &Aacute;lam who sent his son the famous
Sh√°h &Aacute;lam time after time to persuade Kam√°l to be
loyal to Gujar√°t. At last Kam√°l produced a writing said
to be from heaven giving the victory to M√°lwa. The young
Sh√°h &Aacute;lam tore this charter to shreds, and, as no evil
befel him, Kam√°l saw that his spiritual power paled before
Sh√°h &Aacute;lam and fell back dead. Sh√°h &Aacute;lam
against his will accompanied Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n some marches on his
advance to Kapadvanj. Before leaving the army Sh√°h &Aacute;lam
blessed a mean camp elephant and ordered him to destroy the famous
M√°lwa champion elephant known as the Butcher. He also, against
his wish for he knew the future, at the Sult√°n&rsquo;s request
bound his own sword round Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s waist. In the
battle the commissariat elephant ripped the Butcher and some years
later Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n by accident gashed his knee with the
saint&rsquo;s sword and died. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"

M√°lwa Sult√°n retired and shortly after

Chitor<a class="noteref" id="n242.2src" href="#n242.2" name="n242.2src">29</a> now began interfering in the N√°gor succession
on behalf of Shams Kh√°n, who had been dispossessed by his
brother Muj√°hid Kh√°n, and expelled Muj√°hid. But as
Shams Kh√°n refused to dismantle the fortifications of
N√°gor, the Chitor chief collected an army to capture
N√°gor, while Shams Kh√°n repaired to Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n
Sh√°h for aid and gave that sovereign his daughter in marriage.
Upon this Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n sent R√°i Anupchand M√°nek and
Malik Gad√°i with an army to N√°gor to repulse the
R√°na of <span class="marginnote">War with Chitor,

Gujar√°t troops were defeated, and the R√°na after laying

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1455&ndash;56, to avenge this raid,
Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n Sh√°h marched against Chitor. On his way the
Devra R√°ja of Sirohi<a class="noteref" id="n242.3src" href="#n242.3" name="n242.3src">30</a> attended Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n

R√°na of Chitor had wrested from his house. The king ordered one

&Aacute;bu and restore it to the Devra chieftain, while he himself
continued to advance against <span class="corr" id="xd25e25464" title="Source: Kumbh√°mer">Kumbhalmer</span>. Malik
Sha&acirc;b√°n was entangled in the defiles near &Aacute;bu, and
defeated with great slaughter, and shortly after Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n
Sh√°h, making a truce with Chitor, retired to his own country. On
his return the M√°lwa sovereign proposed that they should unite
against Chitor, conquer the R√°na&rsquo;s territories, and divide
them equally between them. Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n agreed and in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1456&ndash;57 marched against the

to the Devra R√°ja.<a class="noteref" id="n242.5src" href="#n242.5" name="n242.5src">32</a> Next, advancing upon Kumbhalmer, he
plundered the country round, and then turned towards Chitor. On his way
to Chitor, he was met by the R√°na, and a battle was fought,
after which the R√°na fell back on his capital, and was there
besieged by the Gujar√°t army. The siege was not pressed, and, on
the R√°na agreeing to pay tribute and not to harass N√°gor,
Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n withdrew to Gujar√°t, where he gave himself up

N√°gor. Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n Sh√°h, though so overcome with
drink as to be unable to sit his horse, mustered his troops and started
in a palanquin. As soon as the R√°na heard that the <span class="corr" id="xd25e25480" title="Source: Guj√°rat">Gujar√°t</span> army was in motion he
retired, and the king returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In

He was brave with a sternness of nature, which, under the influence of

Sult√°n-i-Gh√°zi the Warrior King.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mahm&uacute;d I. (Begada),
1459&ndash;1513.</span>On the death of Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n Sh√°h,
the nobles raised to the throne his uncle D√°&uacute;d, son of
&Aacute;hmed Sh√°h. But as D√°&uacute;d appointed low-born
men to high offices and committed other foolish acts, he was deposed,
and in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1459 his half-brother Fateh
Kh√°n the son of Muhammad Sh√°h, son of &Aacute;hmed
Sh√°h by B&iacute;bi Mughli a daughter of J√°m J&uacute;na
of Thatha in Sindh, was seated on the throne at the age of little more
than thirteen with the title of Mahm&uacute;d Sh√°h.</p>
<p>The close connection of Fateh Kh√°n with the saintly
Sh√°h &Aacute;lam is a favourite topic with Gujar√°t
historians. According to the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text,
66&ndash;70) of his two daughters J√°m J&uacute;na intended
B&iacute;bi Mughli the more beautiful for the Saint and B&iacute;bi
Mirghi the less comely for the Sult√°n. By bribing the
J√°m&rsquo;s envoys the king secured the prettier sister. The
enraged Saint was consoled by his father who said: My son, to you will
come both the cow and the calf. After Muhammad II.&rsquo;s death, fear
of Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s designs against the young Fateh
Kh√°n forced B&iacute;bi Mughli to seek safety with her sister,
and on her sister&rsquo;s death she married the Saint.
Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n made several attempts to seize Fateh Kh√°n.
But by the power of the Saint when Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n attempted to
seize him, Fateh Kh√°n in body as well as in dress became a girl.
According to one account Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n met his death in an attempt
to carry off Fateh Kh√°n. As he rode into the Saint&rsquo;s
quarter Death in the form of a mad camel met the king. The king struck
at the phantom, and his sword cleaving the air gashed his knee. This
was the Saint&rsquo;s sword, which against his will, for he knew it
would be the death of the king, Kutb-ud-d&iacute;n forced Sh√°h
&Aacute;lam to bind round him before the battle of Kapadvanj.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Defeats a Conspiracy, 1459.</span>The death
of his uncle, the late Sult√°n D√°&uacute;d, who had become
a religious devotee, relieved Fateh Kh√°n of one source of
danger. Shortly after certain of the nobles including Seiful Mulk,
Kab&iacute;r-ud-d&iacute;n Sult√°ni surnamed Akd-ul-Mulk,
Burh√°n-ul-Mulk and His√°m-ul-Mulk represented to the

Im√°d-ul-Mulk contemplated treason and wished to set his son on
the throne. Having seized and imprisoned the minister in the Bhadra
citadel and set five hundred of their trusted retainers as guards over
him, the rebels retired to their homes. At nightfall Abdull√°h,
the chief of the elephant stables, going to the young Sult√°n
represented to him that the nobles who had imprisoned
Im√°d-ul-Mulk were the real traitors and had determined to place
Hab&iacute;b Kh√°n, an uncle of the Sult√°n&rsquo;s, on the
throne. The Sult√°n consulting his mother and some of his
faithful friends ordered Abdull√°h at daybreak to equip all his
elephants in full armour and draw them up in the square before the
Bhadra. He then seated himself on the throne and in a voice of feigned
anger ordered one of the courtiers to bring out Sha&acirc;b√°n
Im√°d-ul-Mulk, that he might wreak his vengeance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>

Bhadra called: &ldquo;Bring out Sha&acirc;b√°n!&rdquo; The guards
brought forth Im√°d-ul-Mulk, and the Sult√°n ordered his
fetters to be broken. Some of the nobles&rsquo; retainers made their
submission to the Sult√°n, others fled and hid themselves. In the
morning, hearing what had happened, the refractory nobles marched
against the Sult√°n. Many advised the Sult√°n to cross the
S√°barmati by the postern gate and retire from the city, and,
after collecting an army, to march against the nobles. Giving no ear to
these counsels the young Sult√°n ordered Abdull√°h to
charge the advancing nobles with his six hundred elephants. The charge
dispersed the malcontents who fled and either hid themselves in the
city or betook themselves to the country. Some were killed, some were
trampled by the Sult√°n&rsquo;s orders under the elephants&rsquo;
feet, and one was pardoned.<a class="noteref" id="n244.1src" href="#n244.1" name="n244.1src">34</a> His religious ardour, his love of

of land grants to the son of the holder, and in cases where there was
no male issue of half the grant to the daughter. His firm policy of

Mahm&uacute;d Samarkandi, on his way from the Dakhan to Central Asia,

Mahm&uacute;d Sh√°h sent an army to ravage
Ch√°mp√°ner, which he was determined to conquer. About this
time, hearing that the neighbourhood was infested with robbers, he
founded the city of Mehm&uacute;d√°b√°d on the banks of the
V√°trak, about eighteen miles south of

killing most of his men and capturing two elephants and several horses.

<span class="marginnote">War against Ch√°mp√°ner,

A morning assault was planned and the first gate carried. Then Malik
Ay√°z Sult√°ni finding a practicable breach passed through

<b>Mahm&uacute;d I. (Begada), 1459&ndash;1513.</b></span> Mahm&uacute;d
Begada&rsquo;s court was adorned by several pious and high-minded
nobles. In life they vied with one another in generous acts; and after
death, according to the Persian poet Urfi, they left their traces in
the characters and carvings of stone walls and marble piles. First
among these nobles the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 132, 142)
mentions D√°war-ul-Mulk, whose god-fearing administration made
his estates so prosperous that they were coveted by princes of the
blood. As Th√°nad√°r of Amron in north
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, he spread the light of
Isl√°m from Morvi to Bh&uacute;j, and after his death his fame as
a spirit-ruling guardian drew hosts of sick and possessed to his shrine
near Morvi. The second was Malik Ay√°z, governor of Diu, who
built the strong fortress afterwards reconstructed by the Portuguese.
He also built a tower on an under-water rock, and from the tower drew a
massive iron chain across the mouth of the harbour. A substantial
bridge over the creek, that runs through the island of Diu, was
afterwards destroyed by the Portuguese. The third was Khud√°wand
Kh√°n &#256;l&iacute;m, the founder of &#256;l&iacute;mpura a
suburb to the south of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, adorned with a
mosque of sandstone and marble. He introduced the cultivation of melons
figs and sugarcane into Gujar√°t from Bij√°pur. The fourth
was Im√°d-ul-Mulk &#256;sas who founded &Iacute;sanpur, a suburb
between Sh√°h <span class="corr" id="xd25e26035" title="Source: Alam&rsquo;s">&Aacute;lam&rsquo;s</span> suburb of
Isl√°mpur and Batwa, and planted along the road groves of
<i>khirnis</i> and mangoes. The fifth was T√°jkh√°n
S√°l√°r, so loved of his peers that after his death none of
them would accept his title. The sixth was Malik S√°rang
Kiw√°m-ul-Mulk, a R√°jput by birth, the founder of the
suburb of S√°rangpur and its mosque to the east of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. The seventh and eighth were the
Khur√°s√°ni brothers A&acirc;zam and Mo&acirc;zzam, who
built a cistern, a mosque, and a tomb between
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and Sarkhej.</p>
<p>Besides Khal&iacute;l Kh√°n, who succeeded him, Mahm&uacute;d
had three sons: Muhammad K√°la, &Aacute;p√° Kh√°n,

R√°ni&rsquo;s Haz&iacute;ra. The second son &Aacute;p√°
Kh√°n was caught trespassing in a noble&rsquo;s

Niz√°m Kh√°n took &Iacute;dar and gave it to

a dog S√°nga, chained him in the fort, and dared the R√°na
to carry him away. His successes enabled S√°nga to answer the
challenge. In consequence of dissensions at head-quarters Niz√°m
Kh√°n withdrew to Ahmednagar leaving a small garrison in

B√°h√°dur Kh√°n, ostensibly dissatisfied with the
smallness of his estates but really to remove himself from the jealousy
of his brother Sikandar who being appointed heir-apparent was seeking
his life, left <span class="corr" id="xd25e26138" title="Source: Guj√°rat">Gujar√°t</span> and withdrew to
Hindust√°n. King Muzaffar, after formally appointing his son

<span class="marginnote">Dies, 1526.</span>died at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1526, after a reign of fourteen years and nine
months. Muzaffar was buried in the shrine of Sheikh &Aacute;hmed Khattu
at Sarkhej near his father&rsquo;s grave. He was the most learned and
one of the most pious of the &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
Sult√°ns. So extreme an abstainer was he that not only during his
whole life did he eschew intoxicating drugs and liquor but he never
again rode a favourite horse because the horse was cured by a draught
of wine. He was an accomplished musician, a finished horseman, a
practised swordsman, and withal so modest and humble in his dress and
temper that observing once to a favourite page how simple and yet
graceful his own turban was the boy laughed: &lsquo;Ay, if the turbans
of Mullahs and Bohoras are graceful, then is your
Majesty&rsquo;s.&rsquo; The Sult√°n said &lsquo;I should have
been proud to have my turban likened to a Mullah&rsquo;s, why compare
it with the headdress of a schismatic Bohora.&rsquo; Muzaffar was
careful never to pain the feelings of those around him. He suspected
Kiw√°m-ul-Mulk who was in charge of his drinking water but
contented himself with breathing over the water one of the verses of
the Kur&acirc;√°n which make poison harmless.<a class="noteref"
id="n252.1src" href="#n252.1" name="n252.1src">54</a> During his reign
cultivation increased so much in Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a
that it became necessary to reserve certain waste land for pasture. In
1526 the rains held off so long that famine began to rage. The
Sult√°n exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh Allah! If thou scourgest the country
for the sins of its king take his life and spare thy creatures.&rsquo;
The prayer was heard and the soul of the guardian Sult√°n passed
in a flood of gracious rain.<a class="noteref" id="n252.2src" href="#n252.2" name="n252.2src">55</a></p>

endeavoured to rescue them. The attempt failed, and the prisoners were
put to death by their guards. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1531, on Bah√°dur&rsquo;s return from

Muhammadan women who had belonged to the har&iacute;m of Sult√°n
N√°sir-ud-d&iacute;n of M√°lwa, Bah√°dur marched
against him and forced him to surrender and embrace Isl√°m. The
chief secretly sent to the R√°na of Chitor for aid and delayed
handing over R√°isin. On learning this Bah√°dur despatched
a force to keep Chitor in check and pressed the siege. At his own
request, Silehdi was sent to persuade the garrison to surrender. But
their reproaches stung him so sharply, that, joining with them, and
after burning their women and children, they sallied forth sword in
hand and were all slain. R√°isin fell into Bah√°dur&rsquo;s
hands, and this district together with those of <span class="corr" id="xd25e26310" title="Source: Bh&iacute;lsa">Bhilsa</span> and Chanderi

Bah√°dur Sh√°h quarrelled with Hum√°y&uacute;n,
emperor of Delhi. The original ground of quarrel was that
Bah√°dur Sh√°h had sheltered Sult√°n Muhammad
Zam√°n M&iacute;rza the grandson of a daughter of the emperor
B√°bar (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1482&ndash;1530).
Hum√°y&uacute;n&rsquo;s anger was increased by an insolent answer
from the Gujar√°t king. Without considering that he had provoked
a powerful enemy, Bah√°dur Sh√°h again laid siege to
Chitor, and though he heard that Hum√°y&uacute;n had arrived at
Gw√°lior, he would not desist from the siege. <span class="marginnote">Fall of Chitor, 1535.</span>In March 1535 Chitor fell into
the hands of the Gujar√°t king but near Mandas&uacute;r his army
was shortly afterwards routed by Hum√°y&uacute;n. According to
one account, the failure of the Gujar√°t army was due to
Bah√°dur and his nobles being spell-bound by looking at a heap of
salt and some cloth soaked in indigo which were mysteriously left
before Bah√°dur&rsquo;s tent by an unknown elephant. The usual
and probably true explanation is that R&uacute;mi Kh√°n the Turk,
head of the Gujar√°t artillery, betrayed Bah√°dur&rsquo;s
interest.<a class="noteref" id="n255.4src" href="#n255.4" name="n255.4src">64</a> Still though R&uacute;mi Kh√°n&rsquo;s

Ch√°mp√°ner, and finally took refuge in Diu.
Ch√°mp√°ner fell to Hum√°y&uacute;n, and the whole of
Gujar√°t, except Sorath, came under his rule. At this time Sher

Gujar√°t. During Hum√°y&uacute;n&rsquo;s time of success
Bah√°dur Sh√°h, being forced to court the <span class="marginnote">The Portuguese at Diu, 1536.</span>Portuguese, had granted
them leave to erect a factory in Diu. Instead of a factory the
Portuguese built a fort. When he recovered his kingdom, Bah√°dur,
repenting of his alliance with the Portuguese, went to Sorath to
persuade an army of Portuguese, whom he had asked to come to his
assistance, to return to Goa. When the Portuguese arrived at Diu five
or six thousand strong the Sult√°n hoping to get rid of them by
stratagem, repaired to Diu and endeavoured to get the viceroy into his
power. The viceroy excused himself, and in return invited the king to
visit his ship. <span class="marginnote">Death of Bah√°dur,

of Bah√°dur&rsquo;s assassination was that a paper from him to
the kings of the Dakhan, inviting them to join him in an alliance
against the Portuguese, had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese
viceroy. Whatever may have been the provocation or the intention, the
result seems to show that while both sides had treacherous designs
neither party was able to carry out his original plan, and the end was

at Im√°d-ul-Mulk&rsquo;s request allowed him to go on pilgrimage
to Makkah. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1545 as he was

succeeded in Surat by Khud√°wand Kh√°n R&uacute;mi, who had

intrigue, had five years before completed the building of Surat

on the slightest pretence, branding R√°jputs and Kolis, forcing
them to wear a red rag on the right sleeve, forbidding them to ride in

the stock of &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h of the name of &Aacute;hmed

one undertaking to protect the frontiers and preserve the public peace.
Mub√°rak Sh√°h of Kh√°ndesh, considering this a good

frontier. An army led by the chief Gujar√°t nobles and
accompanied by the young king met the invaders at the village of

encamping on the north bank and the Kh√°ndesh army on the south

to remain neutral till the battle was over and then to fall on the
exhausted troops and possess himself of both kingdoms. Sayad

Im√°d-ul-Mulk R&uacute;mi did not take to his proposal, he next
endeavoured to ruin Sayad Mub√°rak. But when the Gujar√°t
army marched against him the Sayad made peace, and &Aacute;lam
Kh√°n&rsquo;s intrigues being apparent, he was attacked and
compelled to fly. He now went to Ber√°r and sought aid of
Mub√°rak Sh√°h, who marched an army towards the
Gujar√°t frontier. The Gujar√°t nobles, taking &Aacute;hmed
Sh√°h with them, advanced to oppose him, and he retired.
&Aacute;lam Kh√°n now repaired to Sher Kh√°n Faul√°di

Kh√°n&rsquo;s district of Kadi, but, through the exertions of
Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk, &Aacute;lam Kh√°n was slain and Sher

&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n fled to Mub√°rak Sh√°h in
Kh√°ndesh, and induced him to lead an army against
Gujar√°t. The nobles, fearing this combination, made peaceful
overtures and it was eventually settled that the lands of <span class="marginnote">Sult√°npur and Nandurb√°r handed to

should be given to Mub√°rak Sh√°h, and that
&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n should be restored to his former
position. Since this date the districts of Sult√°npur and
Nandurb√°r have been permanently severed from Gujar√°t and
have formed a part of Kh√°ndesh, to which province they now
belong. &Aacute;hmed Sh√°h, finding himself more strictly guarded
than ever, contrived to flee to Sayad Mub√°rak at Sayadpur, who,
though vexed at his coming, would not refuse him shelter. At this time
H√°ji Kh√°n, a Dehli noble, on his way from Chitor to help
Hum√°y&uacute;n, passed through Gujar√°t with a well
equipped force, and arrived at P√°tan. The Gujar√°t nobles,
especially &Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n and Im√°d-ul-Mulk
R&uacute;mi, conceiving that he came at the Sayad&rsquo;s invitation,
and that the flight of the king was part of the <span class="marginnote">Defeat and Death of Sayad Mub√°rak.</span>plot,
determined to crush the Sayad ere H√°ji Kh√°n could join

Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n from Broach, while &Iacute;tim√°d
Kh√°n sent for T√°t√°r Kh√°n Ghori from Sorath.

to his estate; and he, seeing it would be useless for him to contend
against so overwhelming a force, retired to his possessions at Broach.
Shortly after, having marched against Surat at the request of the
inhabitants who were wearied of the tyranny of Khud√°wand
Kh√°n, he was decoyed by that chief to an entertainment and was
there assassinated. His son Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n marched against
Surat to take vengeance for his father&rsquo;s death, and, finding the
fortress too strong for him, summoned to his aid the Portuguese, to

quarrelled with Jhujh√°r Kh√°n Habshi of Baroda because the
Habshi had installed his nephew, son of Alif Kh√°n Habshi,
without consulting Chang&iacute;z. Jhujh√°r and his nephew being
defeated fled to &Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n, who allotted them a
grant of land. At this time Fateh Kh√°n Bal&uacute;ch, the
proprietor of R√°dhanpur and Sami, was &Iacute;tim√°d

&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n marched to besiege Chang&iacute;z

powerful, endeavoured to make peace. As their efforts failed,

Fateh Kh√°n Bal&uacute;ch. They did so, and Fateh Kh√°n,
after being defeated near R√°dhanpur, took refuge in the fort of

&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d Kings, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1403&ndash;1573.<br>
<b>Muzaffar III. 1561&ndash;1572.</b></span> who on his part was
anxious and fearful. At this time Bijli Kh√°n a Habshi eunuch who
was offended with Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n, because he had resumed
the grant of Cambay, persuaded &Aacute;l&iacute;f Kh√°n and
Jhujh√°r Kh√°n Habshi that Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n had
determined to kill them. The Habshi Kh√°ns, resolving to be
beforehand, invited Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n, with whom they were
intimate, to play a game of <i>chaug√°n</i> or polo.<a class="noteref" id="n264.1src" href="#n264.1" name="n264.1src">79</a>
Chang&iacute;z agreed and when near the Farhat-ul-Mulk mosque, between
the Bhadar and the Three Gates, &Aacute;l&iacute;f Kh√°n, after
making Jhujh√°r Kh√°n a signal, attracted Chang&iacute;z
Kh√°n&rsquo;s notice to the horse on which he was riding saying
it was the best of the last batch imported from the Persian Gulf.
<span class="marginnote">Death of Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n.</span>As
Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n turned to look at the horse, Jhujh√°r
Kh√°n cut him down. The Habshis now plundered Chang&iacute;z
Kh√°n&rsquo;s house, while the M&iacute;rz√°s, mounting,
went south and took possession of Broach, Baroda, and
Ch√°mp√°ner. Sher Kh√°n advanced from Kadi, and
ordered the Habshis to hand him over &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
While treating with him the Habshis secretly summoned
&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n, who, returning with Muzaffar
Sh√°h, entered the city. It was arranged that
&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n should take the place of
Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n, and that the division of Gujar√°t
between Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n and Sher Kh√°n should be
maintained. &Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n found the Habshis so
domineering that he withdrew from public affairs. Afterwards
&Aacute;laf Kh√°n and Jhujh√°r Kh√°n, quarrelling
over the division of Chang&iacute;z Kh√°n&rsquo;s property,
&Aacute;laf Kh√°n left &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and joined
Sher Kh√°n, who, advancing from Kadi, laid siege to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. &Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n now
sought aid from the M&iacute;rz√°s, and M&iacute;rza
Ibr√°h&iacute;m Husain marched from Broach and harassed Sher
Kh√°n&rsquo;s army with his Mughal archers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n and the
Emperor Akbar, 1572.</span>At the same time &Iacute;tim√°d
Kh√°n turned for help to the emperor Akbar, who, glad of any
pretext for driving the M&iacute;rz√°s from their place of refuge
in Gujar√°t, was not slow in availing himself of
&Iacute;tim√°d Kh√°n&rsquo;s proposal. Early in July 1572
he started for <span class="corr" id="xd25e26872" title="Source: &Aacute;hmed√°bad">&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d</span>,

to the custom of the Sult√°ns of Dehli, all of whom had three
names, their family name, their throne name, and their after-death name

Their arms are very thick round shields edged with silk; each man has
two swords, a dagger, and a Turkish bow with very good arrows. Some of
them carry maces, and many of them coats-of-mail, and others tunics
quilted with cotton. The horses have housings and steel headpieces, and
so they fight very well and are light in their movements. The Moorish
horsemen are white and of many countries, Turks and Mamelukes, military
slaves from Georgia Circassia and Mingrelia, Arabs Persians
Khor√°s√°nis Turkomans, men from the great kingdom of
Dehli, and others born in the country itself. Their pay is good, and
they receive it regularly. They are well dressed with very rich stuffs
of gold silk cotton and goat&rsquo;s wool, and all wear caps on their
heads, and their clothes long, such as morisco shirts and drawers, and
leggings to the knee of good thick leather worked with gold knots and
embroidery, and their swords richly ornamented with gold and silver are
borne in their girdles or in the hands of their pages. Their women are

greatly impressed travellers, whose strange tales of him made the king
well-known in Europe. Varthema (1503&ndash;1508) thus describes his
manner of living: &lsquo;The king has constantly 20,000 horsemen. In
the morning when he rises there come to his palace 50 elephants, on
each of which a man sits astride, and the said elephants do reverence
to the king, and, except this, they have nothing else to do. When the
king eats, fifty or sixty kinds of instruments, drums trumpets
flageolets and fifes play, and the elephants again do him reverence. As
for the king himself, his mustachios under his nose are so long that he
ties them over his head as a woman would tie her tresses, and he has a
white beard that reaches to his girdle. As to his food, every day he
eats poison (Hudibras&rsquo; Prince whose &lsquo;daily food was asp and
basilisk and toad&rsquo;), not that he fills his stomach with it, but
he eats a certain quantity, so that when he wishes to destroy any great
person he makes him come before him stripped and naked, and then eats
certain fruits which are called <i>chofole</i> (<i>j√°iphal</i>,
nutmeg), like a muscatel nut. He also eats certain leaves called
<i>tamboli</i> (<i>p√°n</i> or betel leaf; like the leaves of a
sour orange, and with these he eats lime of oyster shells. When he has
chewed this well he spurts it out on the person he wishes to kill, and
so in the space of half an hour the victim falls to the ground dead.
The Sult√°n has also three or four thousand women, and every
night that he sleeps with one, she is found dead in the morning.&rsquo;
Barbosa (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1511) goes further
(Stanley&rsquo;s Trans. 57), saying that so soaked was the king with
poison that if a fly settled on his hand it swelled and immediately
fell dead. This was the result of his early training. For, on
Varthema&rsquo;s companion asking how it was that the king could eat
poison in this manner, certain merchants, who were older than the
Sult√°n, answered that his father had fed him upon poison from
his childhood. (Badger&rsquo;s Varthema, 110.) Of the origin of
Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s surname Begada two explanations are given: (1)
&lsquo;From his mustachios being large and twisted like a
bullock&rsquo;s horn, such a bullock being called Begado; (2) that the
word comes from the Gujar√°ti <i>be</i>, two, and <i>gad</i>, a
fort, the people giving him this title in honour of his capture of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e25953" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1472) and Ch√°mp√°ner
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1484).&rsquo; (Bird&rsquo;s History
of Gujar√°t, 202; Mir&#259;t-i-Ahmedi Persian Text, 74.)
Varthema&rsquo;s account of the poison-eating is probably an
exaggeration of the Sult√°n&rsquo;s habit of opium-eating to
which from his infancy he was addicted. The Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari
(Persian Text, 751) speaks of the great physical power of Mahm&uacute;d
and of his wonderful appetite. Mahm&uacute;d&rsquo;s daily food weighed
forty <i>sers</i> the ser being 15 <i>bahlulis</i> a little over half a
pound. He used to eat about three pounds (5 <i>sers</i>) of parched
gram to dessert. For breakfast, after his morning prayer, Mahm&uacute;d
used to consume a cupfull of pure Makkah honey with a second cupfull of
clarified butter and fifty small plantains called <i>sohan kelas</i>.
At night they set by his bed two plates of
<i>samb&uacute;s√°s</i> or minced mutton sausages. In the morning
Mahm&uacute;d seeing the empty plates used to give thanks: &lsquo;Oh
Allah,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;hadst thou not given this unworthy slave
rule over Gujar√°t, who could have filled his stomach.&rsquo; His
virile powers were as unusual as his appetite. The only woman who could
bear his embraces unharmed was a powerful Abyssinian girl who was his
great favourite. Of the wealth and weapons kept in store the
Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari gives the following details regarding the great
expedition against <span class="corr" id="xd25e25978" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>
(Persian Text, 94): The Sult√°n ordered the treasurer to send
with the army gold coins worth five <i>krors</i>, 1700 Egyptian
Allemand Moorish and Khur√°s√°ni swords with gold handles
weighing 2&frac12; to 3 pounds (4&ndash;5 <i>sers</i>), 1700 daggers
and poignards with gold handles weighing 1 to 1&frac12; pounds
(2&ndash;3 <i>sers</i>), and 2000 Arab and Turki horses with
gold-embroidered housings. All this treasure of coin and weapons the

Colonel Watson took references to the R√°ja of P√°l to
apply to the R√°ja of R√°jp&iacute;pla. An examination of
the passages in which the name P√°l occurs seems to show that the
hill country to the east rather than to the south of <span class="corr"

R√°isingh of P√°l tried to rescue Mahm&uacute;d Khilji on

In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1551 N√°sir Kh√°n fled

references seem to agree in allotting P√°l to the hills of

accord with the local use of P√°l. Mr. Pollen, <abbr title="Indian Civil Service">I.C.S.</abbr>, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr>, Political Agent, Rewa K√°ntha,

troops shut himself in a fortress, and wrote to R√°ja Todar Mal,
who was in P√°tan settling revenue affairs. The M&iacute;rza
defeated the imperial forces in Nandurb√°r and failing to get
possession of Cambay marched straight to

Muzaffar, and that he was leading an outlaw&rsquo;s life, entirely
unaided by them. The viceroy agreed not to molest them, on condition

the viceroy heard that Muzaffar had sought shelter in the Barda hills
in the south-west corner of the peninsula. Advancing to the hills, he
halted his main force outside of the rough country and sent skirmishing
parties to examine the hills. Muzaffar had already passed through
Nav√°nagar and across Gujar√°t to D√°nta in the Mahi
K√°ntha. Here he was once more defeated by the <span class="corr"

J√°m sent in his submission, and the viceroy taking from him, by

others with an army in pursuit. On reaching Jagat it was found that
Muzaffar had already left for a village owned by a R√°jput named

crossed to Kachh. Sewa W√°dhel covering Muzaffar&rsquo;s retreat

R√°ja of Jagat, and after frustrating a scheme devised by that
chief to entrap a body of the troops on board ship under pretence of
pursuing Muzaffar&rsquo;s family, led his men back to <span class="corr" id="xd25e27386" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>.
The viceroy, hearing in what direction Muzaffar had fled, marched to
Morvi, where the J√°m of Nav√°nagar came and paid his
respects. At the same time the Kachh chief, who is called
Kheng√°r by Farishtah and in the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi and
Bh√°ra in the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandri, sent a message that if the
viceroy would refrain from invading his country and would give him his
ancestral district of Morvi and supply him with a detachment of troops,
he would point out where Muzaffar was concealed. The
Kh√°n-i-&Aacute;zam agreed to these terms and the chief captured
Muzaffar and handed him to the force sent to secure him. The
detachment, strictly guarding the prisoner, were marching rapidly
towards Morvi, when, on reaching Dhrol, about thirty miles east of
J√°mnagar, under pretence of obeying a call of nature, Muzaffar
withdrew and cut his throat with a razor, so that he died. <span class="marginnote">Commits Suicide, 1591&ndash;92.</span>This happened in

Mub√°riz, another son of Sher B√°bi, was in charge of one
of the posts under Kadi. Kam√°l Kh√°n Jh√°lori, who
had been removed from the government of P√°lanpur and replaced by
Muhammad Fateh, was now restored to his former post. About the same

villages were taken from Bij√°pur and Kadi and P√°tan and
formed into the separate division of Visalnagar. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1676, the fort of <span class="corr" id="xd25e28621" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°g√°dh&#803;">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>

Umdat-ul-Mulk went against them and remained four months in their
country, subduing them and enforcing tribute. In the end of
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1678, the viceroy paid his respects
to the emperor at Ajm&iacute;r. The emperor forbade the fining of
Musalm√°n officials as contrary to the Muhammadan law and
directed that if guilty of any fault they should be imprisoned or
degraded from office, but not fined. An order was also given to change
the name of the new Visalnagar district to Ras&uacute;lnagar.</p>
<p>At this time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1679) the emperor
was doing his utmost to crush both the R√°na of Udepur and the
R√°tho&#7693;s of M√°rw√°r. While the emperor was at

by a woodcutter who brought the head to Bahlol Kh√°n. The head
was recognized by the chief&rsquo;s widow, who from that day put on

owing to the viceroy&rsquo;s forbearance no serious results followed.
On hearing of the riot the emperor ordered the city to be put under
martial law. The more politic viceroy contented himself by inviting
Sheikh Abu Bakr and others to a banquet. After dinner he gave a piece
of a poisoned watermelon to Abu Bakr, who died and the riot with him.
In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1683 Muhammad Am&iacute;n the

Am&iacute;n was one of the best of Gujar√°t governors. The

were passed forbidding import dues on merchandise, fruit, grass,
firewood, and similar produce entering &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
In 1682 a decree was received ordering pauper prisoners to be provided
with rations and dress at the cost of the state. In 1683 the

that the water reached as far as the <i>T&iacute;n Darw√°zah</i>
or Triple Gateway in the west of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d city.
In consequence of disturbances in Sorath the viceroy called on the
minister to advance funds for an expedition. The minister refused to
make advances without special orders from the emperor. On a reference
to court the minister was directed to make advances in emergent cases.
In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1684, at the request of the
inhabitants of that city Abd&uacute;r Rahm√°n Krori, the governor
of Deva P√°tan, was removed and in his place Muhammad Sayad chose
Sard√°r Kh√°n as governor of Sorath. In the following year
on the death of Sard√°r Kh√°n at Thatha in Sindh, where he
had gone as viceroy, he was, in the first instance, succeeded in the
government of Sorath by Sayad Muhammad Kh√°n. Not long after
Sorath was assigned as a personal estate to the emperor&rsquo;s second
son prince Muhammad &Aacute;zam Sh√°h Bah√°dur and during
the prince&rsquo;s absence Sh√°hwardi Kh√°n was sent to

death of its governor In√°yat Kh√°n, K√°rtalab
Kh√°n started to settle the affairs of Jodhpur. As soon as he
left &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, a rumour spread that a new viceroy
was coming, and the troops, with whom as well as with the people of
Gujar√°t K√°rtalab was most popular, grew mutinous.
<span class="marginnote">He Quells a Mutiny, 1689.</span>On hearing of
this disturbance K√°rtalab Kh√°n at once returned to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and quelled the mutiny. His firmness so
pleased the emperor that he gave him the title of Shuja&acirc;t
Kh√°n, and placed the governor of Jodhpur under his orders.
Shuja&acirc;t Kh√°n now proceeded to Jodhpur, where
Durg√°d√°s <span class="corr" id="xd25e28748" title="Source: R√°thod">R√°tho&#7693;</span>, who had incited
prince Abkar to rebellion, and Aj&iacute;tsingh, the son of
Mah√°r√°ja Jasvantsingh, were causing disturbance. Finding
that a strong resident governor was required to keep the insurgents in
check, Shuja&acirc;t Kh√°n appointed K√°zim Beg Muhammad
Am&iacute;n, a brave and resolute soldier, to be his deputy and
returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. During this viceroyalty the
pay of the leader or <i>jam√°d√°r</i> of a troop of fifty
horse was fixed at &pound;10 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 100); of
a <i>do-aspah</i> or two-horse trooper at &pound;6 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 60); and of an <i>ek-aspah</i> or one-horse trooper
at &pound;3 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 30) a month. An imperial
order was also issued directing the levy on merchandise to be taken at
the place and time of sale instead of the time and place of purchase.
As this change caused loss to the revenue the old system was again
adopted. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1690 the minister
Am√°nat Kh√°n, with the title of &Iacute;tim√°d
Kh√°n, was made military governor of Surat, and Sayad
Muhs&iacute;n was chosen minister in his place. To prevent the peons of
great officials extorting fees and dues officials were forbidden to
entertain peons without payment.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Revolt of Mati√°s and Momn√°s,
1691.</span>In the following year (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1691) an attempt on the part of the emperor to
suppress a body of Musalm√°n sectarians led to a somewhat serious
insurrection. Sayad Sh√°hji was the religious preceptor of the
Mati√°s of Kh√°ndesh and the Momn√°s of
Gujar√°t, two classes of converted Hindus closely allied to the
Khoj√°s of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, all of them
being followers of Sayad Im√°m-ud-d&iacute;n an
Ism√°&icirc;li√°h missionary who came to Gujar√°t
during the reign of Mahm&uacute;d Begada (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1459&ndash;1513). Hearing that his followers paid
obeisance to their veiled spiritual guide by kissing his toe, the
emperor ordered the guide to be sent to court to be examined before the
religious doctors. Afraid of the result of this examination, the Sayad
committed suicide and was buried at Karamtah nine miles south of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. The loss of their leader so enraged his
followers that, collecting from all sides, they marched against Broach,
seized the fort, and slew the governor. The insurgents held the fort of
Broach against the governor of Baroda who was sent to punish them, and
for a time successfully resisted the efforts of his successor Nazar
&Aacute;li Kh√°n. At last, at an unguarded spot, some of the
besiegers stole over the city wall and opening the gates admitted their
companions. The Momn√°s were defeated and almost all slain as
they sought death either by the sword or by drowning to merit their
saint&rsquo;s favour in the next world.</p>

destroying the fort returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n was one of the ablest of
Gujar√°t viceroys. He gave so much of his attention to the
management of Jodhpur, that he used to spend about six months of every
year in M√°rw√°r. He beautified
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d by building the college and mosque still
known by his name near the L√°l Gate. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1642 two hundred cart-loads of marble were
received from the ancient buildings at P√°tan and the deputy
governor Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi wrote that if a thousand
cart-loads more were required they could be supplied from the same
source. At this time the emperor ordered that Sheikh
Akram-ud-d&iacute;n, the local tax-collector, should levy the head tax
from the Hindus of P√°lanpur and Jh√°lor. The viceroy
deputed Muhammad Muj√°hid, son of Kam√°l Kh√°n
Jh√°lori, governor of P√°lanpur to help in collecting.

landholders and guaranteeing other public measures on condition of
service, persuaded them to abandon their alliance with
Durg√°d√°s against whom he sent his deputy K√°zim
Beg, who expelled him from M√°rw√°r. After appointing
Kunv√°r Muhkamsingh, governor of Mertha in M√°rw√°r,
Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n returned to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1693, at the request of Sher Afghan Kh√°n,
governor of Sorath, the walls of the fort of Jagat were restored. In
this year the viceroy went to Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a to
exact tribute. On his return to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d Safdar
Kh√°n B√°bi, governor of P√°tan, wrote to the
viceroy, and at his request the forts of Kambhoi and S√°mprah
were repaired. The viceroy now went to Jodhp&uacute;r and from that
returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. A circumstance in
connection with a sum of <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 7000 spent on
the repairs of forts illustrates the close imperial supervision of
provincial accounts. The item having come to imperial notice from the
provincial disbursement sheets was disallowed as unfair and ordered to
be refunded under the rule that such charges were to be met out of
their incomes by the local governors and military deputy governors.
Imperial officers were also from time to time deputed to collect from
the books of the <i>des√°i&rsquo;s</i> statements of provincial
disbursements and receipts for periods of ten years that they might
render an independent check. In this year the emperor hearing that
Aj&iacute;tsingh and Durg√°d√°s were again contemplating
rebellion ordered the viceroy to Jodhpur. Muhammad Mub√°riz
B√°bi was at the same time appointed deputy governor of Vadnagar,
and an order was issued that the revenue of P√°tan should be paid
to Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n instead of as formerly into the
imperial treasury. In this year also Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi,
governor of P√°tan, was succeeded by Mub√°riz Kh√°n
B√°bi. Not long afterwards under imperial orders the viceroy
directed Muhammad Mub√°riz B√°bi to destroy the Vadnagar
temple of Hateshwar-Mah√°dev the N√°gar
Br√°hmans&rsquo; special guardian.</p>
<p>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1696, Muhammad Bahlol
Sh&iacute;rw√°ni, governor of Baroda, died, and his place was

Escapes.</span>Growing suspicious of the number of messengers from the
prince, he burned his tents and fled. Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi
was sent in pursuit. He was overtaking Durg√°d√°s when
Durg√°d√°s&rsquo; grandson praying his grandfather to make
good his escape, stayed behind with a band of followers, charged the
pursuers, and after a gallant combat, he and his R√°jputs were
slain. The grandson of Durg√°d√°s was killed in a
hand-to-hand fight with Sal√°bat Kh√°n, the son of Safdar
Kh√°n B√°bi. Emerald rings are to this day worn by youths
of the B√°bi families of North Gujar√°t in memory of the
emerald earrings which adorned the young R√°jput and were
afterwards worn by Sal√°bat as trophies of this fight. Meanwhile
Durg√°d√°s had reached Unj√°h-Un√°wa, forty
miles east of P√°tan, and from Unj√°h made his way to
P√°tan. From P√°tan, taking his family with him, he retired
to Thar√°d, and from that to M√°rw√°r, where he was
afterwards joined by Aj&iacute;tsingh of M√°rw√°r, whom the
emperor opposed on the ground of illegitimacy. The imperial troops
followed and took possession of P√°tan, putting to death the head
of the city police.</p>
<p>In his old age the emperor Aurangz&iacute;b became more and more
strict in religious matters. In 1702 an imperial order forbad the
making of almanacs as contrary to the Muhammadan law. Hindus were also
forbidden to keep Muhammadan servants.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Surat, 1700&ndash;1703.</span>About this
time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1700) news arrived that the
Mar√°th√°s with a force of 10,000 horse were threatening
Surat from the foot of the K√°s√°ra pass and the confines
of Sult√°npur and <span class="corr" id="xd25e29035" title="Source: Nan&#775;durb√°r">Nandurb√°r</span>. The viceroy
despatched a body of troops to guard Surat against their incursions.
Disputes between the government and the Portuguese were also injuring
the trade of the province. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1701
the viceroy received an order from Court directing him to destroy the
temple of Somn√°th beyond possibility of repair. The despatch
adds that a similar order had been issued at the beginning of
Aurangz&iacute;b&rsquo;s reign. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1703, at the request of the merchants of
Gujar√°t, with the view of inducing the Portuguese to let ships
from Surat pass unmolested and release some Musalm√°ns who had
been imprisoned on their way back from Makkah, orders were issued that
certain confiscated Portuguese merchandise should be restored to its
owners. An imperial order was also received to encourage the art of
brocade weaving in &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1704, Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi was raised
to be governor of Bij√°pur, about fifty miles north-east of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Sarand√°z Kh√°n was at the
same time appointed to Sorath instead of Muhammad Beg Kh√°n, who
was placed in charge of the lands round &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
As the Mar√°th√°s once more threatened Surat, Mustafa Kuli,
governor of Broach, was sent with 1000 horse to defend the city.</p>
<p>Certain passages in Aurangz&iacute;b&rsquo;s letters to prince

Sorath to anyone but to a B√°bi. Sorath is a place which
commanders of five thousand like Hasan &Aacute;likh√°n and
Safshikan Kh√°n have with difficulty administered. If your
officers follow the principles laid down by the late

two places, it will not soon be restored. For the rest you are your own
master. I say not, do this or do that; look that the end is good, and
do that which is easiest. In another passage (Letter 37 to the same

H√°jip&uacute;r Aminp&uacute;r and other posts where atrocities

Kh√°ndesh, handing charge of Gujar√°t to the minister
Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n until the new viceroy should
arrive. Durg√°d√°s <span class="corr" id="xd25e29077"

to restore the lands formerly granted to Durg√°d√°s, and
Durg√°d√°s was directed to act under Abd&uacute;l
Ham&iacute;d&rsquo;s orders. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1705
the emperor learned that Kh√°nji, a successor of Kutb the high
priest of the Ism√°&icirc;lia Bohor√°s, had sent out twelve
missionaries to win people to his faith, and that his followers had
subscribed <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1,14,000 to relieve those of
their number who were imprisoned. The emperor ordered that the twelve
missionaries should be secured and sent to him and appointed Sunni
Mull√°s to preach in their villages and bring the Bohoras&rsquo;
children to the Sunni form of faith.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Mar√°th√°s enter

into south Gujar√°t with an army 15,000 strong, under the
leadership of Dhan√°ji J√°dhav, defeated the local forces
and laid the country waste. Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n, who
was then in charge of the province, ordered all governors of districts

knowing where the Mar√°th√°s were to be found, they halted
on the Narbada near the B√°ba Pi√°rah ford. Here they
remained for a month and a half, the leaders contenting themselves with
sending out spies to search for the enemy. At last, hearing of the
approach of the Mar√°th√°s, they sent to head-quarters
asking for artillery and other reinforcements. In reply, Abd&uacute;l
Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n, a man of hasty temper, upbraided them for
their inactivity and for allowing so much time to pass without making
their way to Surat. <span class="marginnote">Battle of Ratanp&uacute;r.
Defeat of the Musalm√°ns, 1705.</span>Orders were accordingly at
once issued for an advance, and the army next halted at Ratanp&uacute;r
in R√°jp&iacute;pla. Here, apparently from the jealousy of the
commanders, the different chiefs pitched their camps at some distance
from each other. Finding the enemy&rsquo;s forces thus scattered, the
Mar√°th√°s, under the command of Dhan√°ji
J√°dhav, lost no time in advancing against them. First attacking
the camp of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, they defeated his troops,
killed his son, and took prisoner the chief himself. Only a few of his
men, with his nephew Muhammad A&acirc;zam, escaped to the camp of Nazar
&Aacute;li Kh√°n. Next, the Mar√°th√°s attacked the
army under Muhammad Purdil Kh√°n Shirw√°ni; and it also
they defeated. Of the Musalm√°n army those who were not slain,
drowned in the Narbada, or captured, reached Broach in miserable
plight, where they were relieved by Akbar &Aacute;li Kh√°n. Nazar
&Aacute;li Kh√°n burned his tents and surrendered to the
Mar√°th√°s, by whom he was well treated.</p>

of the Musalm√°ns, 1705.</span>The Mar√°th√°s now
heard that Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n was coming with an

the B√°ba Pi√°rah ford, and there crossed the Narbada. That
very day Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n, with Muhammad Sher and
Muhammad Sal√°bat, sons of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, and
others came to the spot where the Mar√°th√°s were encamped.
All night long they were harassed by the Mar√°th√°s, and
next morning found the enemy ready for a general attack. The
Muhammadans, weary with watching, dispirited from the defeats of Safdar
Kh√°n, and inferior in number to their assailants, were repulsed
and surrounded. The two sons of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, and two
other nobles, seeing that the day was lost, cut their way through the
enemy and escaped, Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d Kh√°n, Nazar
&Aacute;li Kh√°n, and many others were taken prisoners. The
Mar√°th√°s plundered the Muhammadan camp, declared their
right to tribute, levied sums from the adjacent towns and villages and
extorted heavy ransoms which in the case of Abd&uacute;l Ham&iacute;d
Kh√°n was fixed at as large a sum as &pound;30,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 3 <i>l√°khs</i>). <span class="marginnote">Koli Disturbances.</span>The Kolis, seeing the
disorganized state of Gujar√°t, began ravaging the country, and

was recalled to defend the capital. When the news of the defeat at
B√°ba Pi√°rah reached Dehli, the emperor despatched prince

made on the Muhammadan post at Dw√°rka, ordered the temple to be
levelled to the ground. It seems doubtful whether this order was
carried out. Nazar &Aacute;li Kh√°n, who had formerly enjoyed a
grant of Halvad in Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a, had been
driven out by Chandrasingh, chief of V√°nk√°ner; but, on
condition of his expelling Chandrasingh, these lands were again granted
to him. Kam√°l Kh√°n Jh√°lori, leaving under his son
F&iacute;r&uacute;z Kh√°n at P√°lanpur a body of men for
the defence of his charge, advanced to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
to guard the city from Mar√°tha attack. He petitioned that
according to Gujar√°t custom his troops should receive rations so
long as they were employed on imperial service. To this request the
emperor agreed and issued orders to the provincial minister.

the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, whose father was an actor in these

since its capture by Muzaffar in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1583

terror-stricken men<span class="corr" id="xd25e29201" title="Not in source">,</span> women and children laden with as much of their
property as they could carry were pressing from the suburbs into the
city. In the city the streets were crowded with squatters. The cries of
parents bereft of children, added to the din and turmoil of the
soldiery, was like the horror of the Day of Resurrection. The dejected
faces of the soldiers beaten in the late engagements added to the
general gloom. The viceroy, thoroughly alarmed, concluded a treaty with
B√°l√°ji, and on receiving a tribute of &pound;21,000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 2,10,000) the Mar√°th√°s

Ibr√°h&iacute;m Kh√°n was confirmed in the post of viceroy

&pound;10,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1 <i>l√°kh</i>)
and leave the city. Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n next interfered
with the lands of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, the deputy governor
of Godhra, and his brothers. On one of the brothers repairing to Dehli
and remonstrating, Haidar K&uacute;li, who, above all things, was a
Muhammadan and anxious to strengthen himself with the Muhammadan
nobility of Gujar√°t, restored their lands to the B√°bis.
In consequence of this decision ill-feeling sprung up between
Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n and the B√°bis, and when
Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n went to exact tribute he forced
Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, governor of Kaira, to pay a special
fine of &pound;1000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 10,000). Shortly
after one of the viceroy&rsquo;s officers, K√°s&iacute;m
&Aacute;li Kh√°n, while employed against the Kolis of that part
of the country, was killed at Peth√°pur. Shuj√°&acirc;t
Kh√°n advanced, and revenged K√°s&iacute;m
&Aacute;li&rsquo;s death by burning the town. Next, he passed into
Sorath, and after exacting tribute, crossed to Kachh. The chief opposed
him, and in the fight that followed was beaten and forced to pay about
&pound;22,500 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 2&frac14;

austerity and craft were a source of not less anxiety to the Dehli
court than Haidar K&uacute;li&rsquo;s more daring and restless
ambition. Haidar K&uacute;li Kh√°n, unable to contend with the
Niz√°m, left Dehli and retired to Gujar√°t. On his way the
villagers of Dabh√°li opposed him killing one of his chief men
named Alif Beg Kh√°n. Haidar burned the village and put all the
people to death, a severity which caused such terror that throughout
his rule no difficulty was experienced in realizing tribute or in
keeping the roads safe. About this time, among other changes, Muhammad
Bah√°d&uacute;r, son of Sal√°bat Kh√°n B√°bi,
was placed in charge of S√°dra and V&iacute;rpur, with the title
of Sher Kh√°n. Shortly after his arrival the viceroy marched
against and subdued the rebellious Kolis of the Chunv√°l,
appointing Rustam &Aacute;li Kh√°n his governor there. Then,
returning to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, he took up his residence
in the Bhadra. <span class="marginnote">Shows signs of Independence and

K&uacute;li aimed at bringing all Gujar√°t under his rule. He
seized the imperial horses which passed through
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d on their way to Dehli, and confiscated
many estates and gave them to his own men. On his way to enforce
tribute from the Dungarp&uacute;r chiefs, he levied &pound;8000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 80,000) from
Lun√°v√°&#7693;a. Through the mediation of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e29625" title="Source: Udep&uacute;r">Udepur</span>
R√°na, and as he agreed to pay a tribute of &pound;10,000 (1

Haidar K&uacute;li next proceeded to Bij√°pur, north of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, but hearing that the emperor was
displeased at his assumption of the power of giving and changing grants
of land, he returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and restored
several estates which he had confiscated. <span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Niz√°m-ul-Mulk</span> Fifty-first

<p>Haidar K&uacute;li Kh√°n, finding himself no match for the
Niz√°m, was induced to retire quietly, and accordingly left
Gujar√°t by way of Dungarpur. Shuj√°&acirc;t Kh√°n
and Rustam &Aacute;li Kh√°n accompanied him as far as
Dungarp&uacute;r, and then returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
In the meantime the Niz√°m had reached Ujjain, and thence
directed Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi to carry on the government till
he should arrive, appointing at the same time his uncle <span class="marginnote">H√°mid Kh√°n Deputy Viceroy; Mom&iacute;n

Niz√°m came to Gujar√°t and chose officers of his own for
places of trust, the chief of whom was Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, who
was appointed governor of Surat. The Niz√°m then returned to
Dehli, but, after a short time, disgusted with his treatment at court,
he retired to the Dakhan, where, making <span class="corr" id="xd25e29644" title="Source: Haidar√°bad">Haidar√°b√°d</span> his
capital, he gradually began to act as an independent ruler. Meanwhile
in Gujar√°t dissensions sprang up between H√°mid
Kh√°n and other officers, but matters were arranged without any
outbreak of hostility. Tribute was exacted from the chiefs on the banks
of the V√°trak and from Modhera an unruly Koli village was burned
down, and garrisons were placed in the Koli country. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1723 Rustam &Aacute;li Kh√°n and

be able, in concert with H√°mid Kh√°n, to re-conquer the

that he had defended &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d against them. The

Peshwa B√°jir√°v Bal√°l, to whom, as agent of his

obnoxious, sent Ud√°ji Pav√°r to drive P&iacute;l√°ji
away. In this Ud√°ji was successful, and defeating
P&iacute;l√°ji forced him to seek the aid of
K√°nt√°ji. K√°nt√°ji, perceiving that if the
Peshwa became supreme his own independence would suffer, joined
P&iacute;l√°ji, and marching together upon Baroda they
endeavoured, but without success, to prevent the Musalm√°n
governor Sadr-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n from entering the city. About

one-tenth shares in the revenue of the province were guaranteed to him,
he would protect Gujar√°t from other invaders. Though he did not
consent to these proposals, the viceroy so far accepted the alliance of
the Peshwa as to allow the governor of Baroda to aid Ud√°ji
Pav√°r against P&iacute;l√°ji. <span class="marginnote">Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r obtains Baroda and

outman&oelig;uvred Ud√°ji and prevented him from effecting a

abandon both that city and the stronghold of Dabhoi, while Ud√°ji
retired to M√°lwa. P&iacute;l√°ji G√°ikw√°r now
obtained possession of Baroda. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk, still sorely
pressed for funds, marched into Sorath to exact tribute. On reaching
V&iacute;ramg√°m, Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n
B√°bi, on behalf of the J√°m of Nav√°nagar, presented
the viceroy with &pound;10,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1
<i>l√°kh</i>), and for this service was rewarded with the gift of
an elephant. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk then marched against Chh√°ya,
the capital of the chief of Porbandar in the south-west of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. This chief, by putting to sea,
hoped to escape the payment of tribute. But on hearing that the viceroy
proposed to annex his territory and appoint an officer to govern it, he
returned and agreed to pay a tribute of &pound;4000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 40,000).<a class="noteref" id="n308.1src" href="#n308.1" name="n308.1src">54</a> On his way back to

Halvad in Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a, and there married the
daughter of Jh√°la Prat√°psingh, the chief of that
district, whom he accordingly exempted from the payment of tribute.
About this time the viceroy received orders from the emperor to restore
certain land which he had confiscated, and as he neglected to obey,
certain estates of his in the Panj√°b were resumed. <span class="marginnote">Capture of Ch√°mp√°ner by the

collecting his share of the tribute, he retired to Sorath. The viceroy

together with their wives and children, returned to

<p><span class="marginnote">Mulla Muhammad &Aacute;li raises a
Disturbance at Surat, 1729.</span>In Surat the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1729 was marked by a severe flood in the
T√°pti and by a somewhat serious local disturbance. The chief
cause of the disturbance was Mulla Muhammad &Aacute;li, a rich
Musalm√°n trader of Surat. This man who, as
&Ucirc;mda-tut-tujj√°r or chief of the merchants, had already a
special rank in the city, was tempted to take advantage of the
disorders of the time to raise himself to the position of an
independent ruler. With this object he chose as his head-quarters the
island of P&iacute;ram in the Gulf of Cambay, near the port of Gogha,
and there spent considerable sums in strengthening the island and
tempting settlers to place themselves under his protection. As
P&iacute;ram was not popular Mulla Muhammad fixed on the village of
Athva, on the left bank of the T√°pti, about twelve miles from
its mouth. Here he began to build a fort, but was ordered to desist by
Sohr√°b Kh√°n, the governor of Surat, from which city the
proposed stronghold was only three miles distant. Mulla Muhammad so far
from obeying, persuaded Beglar-Beg Kh√°n the commander of the
fort of Surat to side with him. Accordingly, next day, Beglar-Beg
Kh√°n bombarded the governor Sohr√°b Kh√°n&rsquo;s
residence, proclaiming that his own brother Teghbeg Kh√°n was
appointed governor of Surat. In the end Mulla Muhammad &Aacute;li
induced the chief merchants of the city to pray for the removal of
Sohr√°b who pending receipt of orders from the emperor was made
to hand over his official residence in the city to Teg-Beg
Kh√°n.</p>

R√°i Kishand√°s, agent of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n,
received the district of Petl√°d in farm. From
Na&#7693;i√°d Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk went to collect tribute from
Sar&#7693;√°rsingh, the chief of Bh√°darva in the Rewa
K√°ntha about fifteen miles north of Baroda, on the banks of the
Mahi, who, after some fighting, agreed to pay a sum of &pound;2000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 20,000). On his way back to

chief of Umeta, fifteen miles west of Baroda. As R√°i
Kishand√°s failed to pay the sum agreed on for the farm of

himself from the indignity he committed suicide.</p>

Mulla Muhammad &Aacute;li continued to build the fort at Athva. At last
his accomplice, Beglar-Beg Kh√°n the commander of the Surat fort,
began to perceive that if the Athva fort were completed the Mulla would
be in a position to obstruct the trade of the port of Surat. He
consequently ordered him to stop building. In spite of this the Mulla
succeeded in persuading Sohr√°b Kh√°n to allow him to go on
with his fort promising in return to get him confirmed as governor of
Surat. Sohr√°b Kh√°n agreed, and the fort was completed,
and Sohr√°b Kh√°n was duly appointed governor. As the fort
was immediately below Surat the revenue of Surat was greatly
diminished, and Sohr√°b Kh√°n, when it was too late, saw

himself all the emblems of the governor&rsquo;s office and wrote to the
emperor asking a patent of the governorship of Surat in the name of his

communications were intercepted at Broach by the partisans of Teghbeg,

Bh√°vnagar settled there. When the emperor heard what had

Khander√°v Sen√°pati, heard of the assassination of
P&iacute;l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, she determined to avenge
his death. Collecting an army and taking with her K√°nt√°ji
Kadam and D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, son of
P&iacute;l√°ji, she marched upon &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.
As the Mar√°th√°s failed to do more than slay a
R√°jput leader named J&iacute;var√°j they came to terms. In
the end it was agreed that in addition to the one-fourth and the
one-tenth shares of the revenue a sum of &pound;8000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 80,000) should be paid from the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d treasury, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n
being kept as a hostage till the payments were made. For his services
on this occasion Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was made governor of
V&iacute;ramg√°m. During this year an imperial order appointed
Khush√°lchand Sheth, son of S√°ntid√°s, Nagar Sheth
or chief merchant of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. The
Mar√°th√°s plundered Ras&uacute;l√°b√°d a mile
south of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and its excellent library was
pillaged. Um√°b√°i now marched upon Baroda, and the
governor, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, prepared to oppose the
Mar√°th√°s. But Um√°b√°i, sending a message to
Sher Kh√°n, explained that she had just concluded a peace with
the Mah√°r√°ja, and was suffered to pass unmolested. The
emperor, satisfied with the arrangements made by the
Mah√°r√°ja, presented him with a dress of honour.

on the former basis, and J√°doji marched into Sorath to exact
tribute. In this year the Kolis of the Ch&uacute;nv√°l and
K√°nkrej committed many excesses, and a R√°jput noble was
robbed in the P√°tan district. In the meantime Sohr√°b

by Bh√°vsinghji the chief of Sihor, began to raise a following

compelled to leave Gogha. The deputy governor of Sorath complained to
the governor of the oppressive conduct of Sohr√°b Kh√°n.

Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, who directed Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n, the governor of Cambay, to join Sher Kh√°n and drive
back the Mar√°th√°s. Sher Kh√°n started at once for
Baroda. But M√°hadaji leaving a sufficient force before the town
pushed on with the bulk of his army to meet Sher Kh√°n, and,
though he and his men fought bravely, defeated him, and then returned
to Baroda, Sher Kh√°n retiring to B√°l√°sinor.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, who arrived after Sher Kh√°n&rsquo;s
defeat, did not deem it prudent to engage the Mar√°th√°s,
and retired to Cambay. In the meantime the garrison of Baroda, hopeless
of succour, surrendered the town, and since that day Baroda has

V&iacute;ramg√°m he had become much disliked. For this reason
Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, transferred him to Kadi
and Bij√°pur, and in his place appointed Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi, whose father Muhammad Sal√°b√°t Kh√°n
B√°bi had been a popular governor of V&iacute;ramg√°m. At
this time Dhanr&uacute;p Bhand√°ri, governor of Petl√°d,
died, and the farm of the districts of Na&#7693;i√°d,
Arhar-M√°tar, Petl√°d, and Mahudha was given to
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n. Mulla Muhammad &Aacute;li managed to write
letters from his confinement at Surat to the Niz√°m; and as that
chief was now not far from Surat, he wrote urgently to Teghbeg
Kh√°n to release him. Teghbeg Kh√°n put the Mulla to death,
and bribing the Niz√°m&rsquo;s messenger, gave out that he had
died of joy at his release. Khush√°lchand, the chief of the
merchants of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, having had a difference
with Ratansingh, was forced to leave the city, and sought shelter at
Cambay and afterwards at <span class="corr" id="xd25e30234" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>.
<span class="marginnote">Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n fails in an

Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh. He accordingly marched upon
&Iacute;dar, taking with him as allies Aghr√°ji Koli of Katosan
and Koli Amra of Elol K√°nrah. In this strait Anandsingh and
R√°isingh sought the aid of Malh√°rr√°v <span class="corr" id="xd25e30240" title="Source: Holk√°r">Holkar</span> and
R√°noji Sindia, who were at this time in M√°lwa. The
Mar√°tha chiefs at once marched to the help of &Iacute;dar, and
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, disbelieving the report of
Mar√°tha aid, continued to advance until he found himself opposed
by an overwhelming force. Negotiations were entered into, and
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n agreed to pay a sum of &pound;17,500
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1,75,000). Of the total amount
&pound;2500 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 25,000) were paid at once,
and Zor√°war Kh√°n, brother of Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n, and Ajabsingh, agent of Aghr√°ji Koli, were kept as
hostages until the balance should be paid. In this year Teghbeg
Kh√°n of Surat caused a wealthy merchant named &Aacute;hmed

caused a fanatic named Sayad &Aacute;li to be put to death by certain

Abheysingh. When this order reached Sohr√°b Kh√°n, he
forwarded it to Burh√°n-ul-Mulk, and in consequence of

changed and Sohr√°b Kh√°n appointed governor. Upon this

others to his assistance, and with his own army proceeded to Dholka and
plundered Koth. From Koth he advanced and pitched at Har√°lah,
about ten miles from Sohr√°b Kh√°n&rsquo;s camp, and here

summoned to support him. <span class="marginnote">Battle of Dholi.

Sohr√°b Kh√°n should enjoy V&iacute;ramg√°m until
final orders were passed by the emperor. Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi

Ratansingh, who in two months had recovered from his injuries, now
determined to attack Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, as that officer in the
recent struggle had taken part with Sohr√°b Kh√°n.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n hearing of Ratansingh&rsquo;s intentions,
withdrew to Cambay. In the course of this year, on the expiry of the

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1736) Rangoji advanced as far as
B√°vla near Dholka wasting the country. Ratansingh
Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, marched against him, and forced
him to retire to V&iacute;ramg√°m. Ratansingh pursued the
Mar√°th√°s to V&iacute;ramg√°m, attacked and defeated
them capturing their baggage, but failed to prevent them taking shelter
in the town. About this time some Mar√°tha horse who were at

serious resistance succeeded in capturing the town. Meanwhile though
Ratansingh had summoned Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n to his aid, he delayed

<p>Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard that Prat√°pr√°v,

advancing on &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d with 10,000 horse. At first
he thought this a device to draw him from V&iacute;ramg√°m, to
whose walls his mines had reached. On ascertaining from trusty spies
that the report was true, he raised the siege of
V&iacute;ramg√°m, returned rapidly to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and pushing forward to meet
Prat√°pr√°v, exacted tribute from the chiefs on the banks

Rangoji. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri made preparations to help Sher
Kh√°n and Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n returned to Cambay.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n</span> Fifty-fourth Viceroy, 1737.</span>At this time as
the Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh was not in favour at court,
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n was appointed fifty-fourth viceroy. As he was
unable to effect anything by himself he persuaded Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n B√°bi to join him by a promise of the government of
P√°tan and directed him to proceed and take up that appointment.
Now the Jh√°loris were allies of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e30363" title="Source: R√°thods">R√°tho&#7693;s</span>, and Pah√°r
Kh√°n Jh√°lori, then in command of P√°tan, opposed
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, but was finally obliged to vacate
P√°tan. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, who had not hitherto produced
the order appointing him viceroy, now made it public and began to act
as viceroy with the title of Najm-ud-daul√°h Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n Bah√°dur <span class="corr" id="xd25e30366" title="Source: Fir&uacute;z">F&iacute;r&uacute;z</span> Jang, and in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1737 sent a copy of this order to
Abd&uacute;l Husain Kh√°n, the deputy minister, and to
Mustaf&iacute;d Kh√°n, who held the office of K√°zi.</p>
<p>Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, wishing to remain neutral, retired to
B√°l√°sinor and Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n summoned Rangoji,
who was in the neighbourhood of Cambay, to his assistance. Rangoji
agreed to aid him in expelling the M√°rv√°dis, on condition
that, if successful, he should be granted one-half of the produce of
Gujar√°t except the city of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, the
lands in the neighbourhood of the city, and the port of Cambay. This
disastrous alliance with the Mar√°th√°s gave the last blow
to Mughal power in Gujar√°t, which otherwise might have lingered
for at least a quarter of a century. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n lived to
repent his conduct.</p>
<p>When Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard of the appointment of
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n to be viceroy he wrote to
Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh for orders. Meanwhile he sent
Muhammadan officials to Cambay to persuade Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n to
take no further steps until a reply should be received to the reference
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n had made to &Aacute;gra. The reply of the
Mah√°r√°ja was that Ratansingh should resist Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n if he could. Ratansingh prepared to defend
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d while Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
collecting an army, camped at the N√°ransar lake.</p>
<p>From the N√°ransar lake where Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
remained encamped for one and a half months collecting his partisans he
advanced to Sojitra, where he was joined by Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n B√°bi; and proceeding together they came to Vasu
under Petl√°d, about twenty-six miles from
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and from Vasu to Kaira, about eighteen
miles from the capital. At Kaira they encamped on the banks of the
V√°trak, where, owing to the incessant rain, they were forced to
remain for about a month. When the rain abated and the rivers were
fordable, Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, moving to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, encamped in front of the city

whom he had sent to Songad to solicit D√°m√°ji to march in
person to his assistance, arrived and informed him that
D√°m√°ji would join him shortly. Zor√°war
Kh√°n, who had been left at the Mar√°tha camp as security
for the payment of the tribute, was recalled, and instead the district
of Par√°ntij was formally assigned to the Mar√°th√°s
in payment of their demands. Some of the Mah√°r√°ja&rsquo;s
guns, which were being sent to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d by his
agents at Surat through Cambay for facility of transit, were about this
time captured by a party of Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s men. When
Ratansingh Bhand√°ri wrote to the Mah√°r√°ja of
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s advance on
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, the Mah√°r√°ja was much
displeased, and went from the emperor&rsquo;s presence in anger. The
nobles fearing the consequences, recalled him, and persuaded the
emperor to re-appoint him viceroy of Gujar√°t.</p>

of the emperor&rsquo;s approbation of this line of conduct. He
therefore continued to prosecute the siege with vigour. In the meantime
another order was received from the imperial court, confirming the
reappointment of the <span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh</span> Fifty-fifth Viceroy,

Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n to guard the city with 500 men,
directing also that Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n should return to Cambay.
It was further stated that, as Ratansingh Bhand√°ri had acted
oppressively, some other person should be appointed deputy to fill his
place, and that in the meantime a R√°jput noble, named
Abhaikaran, was to carry on the government. Shortly before this
Muhammad B√°kir Kh√°n, son of Mu&acirc;tamid Kh√°n,
joined Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n from Surat, while S√°dik
&Aacute;li Kh√°n and his nephew reinforced him from
Jun√°ga&#7693;h. When Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n was informed of
the purport of the imperial order he agreed to return to Cambay,
provided Ratansingh Bhand√°ri would quit the city, hand over
charge to Abhaikaran, and admit Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n
and his men into the city.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Defence of the City by Ratansingh

leave the city, and prepared to defend himself to the last.
D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r now joined Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n from Songad. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n met
D√°m√°ji at &Iacute;sanpur, three miles from
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and made great show of friendship,
calling him his brother. When Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard of the
arrangements made between D√°m√°ji and Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n, he sent a message to D√°m√°ji saying,
&lsquo;Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n has promised Rangoji half of the
revenues of Gujar√°t excepting the city of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, the lands immediately round it, and
Cambay. If you will join me, I will give you half of everything not
excepting the city nor Cambay, and will send to your camp some of my
chief landholders as security if you agree.&rsquo; D√°m√°ji
showed this to Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, and asked him what he proposed
to do. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n now perforce agreed to do the same; but
instead of Cambay offered to make over to the Mar√°th√°s
the whole district of V&iacute;ramg√°m. D√°m√°ji,
accepting these terms, ceased to negotiate with Ratansingh. He then
went on pilgrimage to D&uacute;desar, and returning in the same year,

repented having called them to his aid, and foresaw that if the
Mar√°th√°s once gained any portion of the city it would be
no easy matter to drive them out. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n now sent the
writer of the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi to Ratansingh Bhand√°ri,
in hopes that he might withdraw peaceably, but Ratansingh refused to
listen to any terms. After some time the Musalm√°ns under
K√°zim &Aacute;li Kh√°n and others, and the
Mar√°th√°s under B√°bur√°v endeavoured to take
the city by storm, but after a bloody contest were forced to retire.
Next day Ratansingh, seeing that he could not long hold the city,
entered into a negotiation with Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, and, on
receiving a sum of money for his expenses, and on being allowed to
retire with the honours of war, left the city.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n captures
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, 1738.</span>Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
entered &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. On the capture of the city, in
accordance with Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s engagement, half of it
was handed to the Mar√°th√°s. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n sent
news of what had taken place to the emperor, and appointed
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n his deputy. D√°m√°ji,
who in the meantime had been to Sorath, now returned and was met by
Rangoji, who accompanied him as far as the banks of the Mahi, whence
Rangoji proceeded to Dholka. After spending a few days at Dholka,
Rangoji returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and took charge of
his share of the city, which comprised the R√°ikhar,
Kh√°njch√°n, and Jam√°lpur quarters as far as the
Astoria and R√°ipur gates. The city was thus equally divided, and
the Astoria and Raipur gates were guarded by the
Mar√°th√°s. At that time the inhabitants of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d were chiefly Muhammadans, and the
Mar√°th√°s, accustomed to extortion, attempting to oppress
them, they rose against the strangers, and after a severe affray
expelled the greater part of them from the city. Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n, though secretly pleased, affected ignorance and sent
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n to reassure Rangoji. This with
some difficulty he succeeded in doing and Rangoji remained in the city.
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was sent to P√°tan, and, instead of
Par√°ntij, the district of Kher√°lu was granted to
Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi.</p>

him. They marched to Ad√°laj whence Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n
Kh√°n, the deputy viceroy, returned to the city accompanied by
R√°m√°ji as deputy of Rangoji. Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n and Sher Kh√°n B√°bi now joined the
viceroy&rsquo;s camp, and, about the same time Hathising, chief of
Peth√°pur, paid a visit to the viceroy and settled his tribute.
From Ad√°laj they advanced to M√°nsa, and were met by the
M√°nsa chief. From M√°nsa they proceeded to Kadi, and from
Kadi to B&iacute;j√°pur. After Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n left the
people of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d were badly treated, and
Rangoji, leaving his brother Akoji in camp, returned to the capital,
whence he marched towards V&iacute;ramg√°m and Sorath.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n went from B&iacute;j√°pur to

Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, went to him and paid the tribute of
Mohanpur and Ran√°san as being within the limits of the
&Iacute;dar territory. The matter was amicably settled, and the two
brothers accompanied the viceroy as far as the &Iacute;dar frontier,
when &Aacute;nandsingh returned to &Iacute;dar, and R√°isingh, at
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s request, remained with him,
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n undertaking to pay the expenses of his men.
Prathir√°j, the chief of M√°nsa, <span class="marginnote">The Viceroy collects Tribute, 1738.</span>agreed to pay
&pound;2300 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 23,000) and the chief of

appointed to succeed M&iacute;r Dost &Aacute;li as deputy governor of
Sorath. The Mar√°th√°s, who had attempted to deprive some
of the Ras&uacute;l√°b√°d and Batwa Sayads of their land,
were attacked by the Muhammadan population, and a few men were wounded
on either side. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, receiving tribute from
various chiefs, had now reached P√°lanpur, and <span class="corr"

Kh√°n Jh√°lori, the governor of that place, was introduced

Baroda districts, Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n marched towards
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, dismissing Pah√°r Kh√°n
Jh√°lori on the P√°lanpur frontier. Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n B√°bi, appointing his brother Safdar Kh√°n

for &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. M√°m&uacute;r Kh√°n,
who had been chosen by M&iacute;r Huzabr &Aacute;li as his deputy in
Sorath, now arrived and complained to Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
regarding Sher Kh√°n B√°bi&rsquo;s appointment.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n said that, as neither had assumed charge of
their duties, they should await final orders from the emperor. He then
advanced to H√°jipur, and thence encamped on the side of the city
near Bahr√°mpur and occupied himself in strengthening the city
defences. From that camp he proceeded to &Iacute;sanpur four miles
south of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d on his way to levy tribute from
the Koli chiefs of the banks of the V√°trak. After this he
proceeded to K&uacute;lej on the V√°trak and levied tribute from
the Koli chiefs of that neighbourhood. Hearing that

nephew of Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, governor of Sorath, and he wrote to
his uncle to choose a fitting deputy. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, as the
Mar√°tha incursions into Sorath increased yearly, and as Sher

collector of customs. As he was anxious to clear some misunderstanding
between Rangoji and himself, Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n set out to visit
Rangoji and assure him of his good wishes. At this time
Bh√°vsingh of V&iacute;ramg√°m, who found the
Mar√°th√°s even more troublesome than the Muhammadans, as
soon as he heard of Malh√°rr√°v&rsquo;s recall, suddenly
attacked the fort of V&iacute;ramg√°m and with the aid of some
Arabs and Rohill√°s expelled the Mar√°tha garrison and
prepared to hold the fort on his own account. Shortly after Rangoji
demanded that a tower in &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, which had been
raised a story by Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n so as to command the
residence of the Mar√°tha deputy at the Jam√°lpur gate,
should be reduced to its original height. At the same time he suggested
that Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n and he, uniting their forces, should
advance and expel Bh√°vsingh from V&iacute;ramg√°m.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n agreed to both proposals. The addition to the
tower was pulled down, and Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n and Rangoji,
marching against V&iacute;ramg√°m, laid siege to the town.
Bh√°vsingh made a gallant defence, and Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n,
who was not sorry to see the Mar√°th√°s in difficulties,
after a time left them and marched to Kadi and Bij√°pur to levy
tribute. <span class="marginnote"><span class="corr" id="xd25e30588"

Mar√°th√°s again obtained possession of
V&iacute;ramg√°m, while Bh√°vsingh acquired

<p><span class="marginnote">Siege of Broach by the
Mar√°th√°s, 1741.</span>When Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
arrived at M√°nsa, about twenty-six miles north-west of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, hearing that D√°m√°ji had
crossed the Mahi with 10,000 men, he at once returned to the capital.
D√°m√°ji arrived at M√°nsa and besieged it. The
chiefs and Kolis defended the place bravely for about a month, when it
fell into D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s hands, who not only cleared the
prickly-pear stockade which surrounded it, but also burned the town.
From M√°nsa D√°m√°ji marched to Sorath. On his return
he laid siege to Broach, a fort which, from its natural strength as
well as from its favourable position on the Narbada, it had been the
constant ambition both of D√°m√°ji and of his father
P&iacute;l√°ji to capture. On the approach of
D√°m√°ji, Nek &Aacute;lam Kh√°n, who held the place
in the interests of the Niz√°m, prepared to defend the fort, and
wrote to the Niz√°m for aid. In reply the Niz√°m warned
D√°m√°ji not to attack his possessions. On receiving this
letter D√°m√°ji raised the siege and returned to Songad. It
seems probable that concessions were made to tempt D√°m√°ji
to retire from Broach, and that the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share
in the Broach customs dates from this siege.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Battle of Dholka. Defeat of the
Mar√°th√°s, 1741.</span>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1741 in a battle between K√°im K&uacute;li
Kh√°n, governor of Dholka, and Rangoji&rsquo;s deputy, the
Mar√°th√°s were defeated. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, at the
request of Rangoji, made peace between them. Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n
Kh√°n, who had recently been raised in rank with the title of
Bah√°dur, starting to collect tribute burned down the refractory
Koli village of Dabhora, and placing a post there, passed to
S√°tumba, B√°l√°sinor, and Th√°sra. After the
battle at Dholka, the building by Rangoji of the fort of Borsad, caused
renewed fighting between the Muhammadans and Mar√°th√°s of
Dholka. At the request of Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n, governor of
Dholka, Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n, passing through Mahudha
to Petl√°d pushed forward to help him. <span class="marginnote">Contests between the Musalm√°ns and
Mar√°th√°s.</span>In the meantime a battle was fought, in
which the Mar√°th√°s under Malh√°rr√°v attacked
Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n, and after a short contest withdrew.
Next day the Muhammadans, strengthened by the arrival of
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n, besieged Sojitra. A letter was
written to Rangoji, asking the meaning of the attack, and he replied
excusing himself and attributing it to the ignorance of
Malh√°rr√°v. Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n and the
author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi eventually met Rangoji at
Borsad, and settled that he and Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n
should come together and arrange matters. But Rangoji in his heart
intended to fight and wrote to his deputy R√°m√°ji at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d to be ready for war.
Malh√°rr√°v now joined Rangoji at Borsad. At this time many
misunderstandings and several fights between the Mar√°th√°s
and the Muhammadans were appeased by Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n and
Rangoji, who, in spite of the ill-feeling among their subordinates and
a certain distrust of each other&rsquo;s designs, appear throughout to
have maintained a warm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

stronghold at Songad was too much occupied in Dakhan politics to give
much attention to Gujar√°t. Rangoji, on the other hand, gained so
much influence with the Gujar√°t chiefs, that at one time he
succeeded in engaging Sajansingh Haz√°ri in his service, and also
induced R√°ja R√°isingh of &Iacute;dar to join him. But
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n detached R√°isingh from this alliance,
by placing him in charge of the post of Amali√°ra and granting
him the districts of Mod√°sa, Meghrej, Ahmednagar,
Par√°ntij, and Harsol. Moreover the customary Gujar√°t sum
at first sent daily by Rangoji to R√°ja R√°isingh for the
expenses of his troops had begun to fall into arrears. R√°ja
R√°isingh made his peace with Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n through
the mediation of Nazar &Aacute;li Kh√°n, Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n&rsquo;s nephew, who appears to have been one of the leading
spirits of the time.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disturbance at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, 1742.</span>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1742 in another fight between the
Mar√°th√°s and Muhammadans in
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, the Muhammadans gained a slight
advantage. After this Rangoji left the city, appointing as before
R√°m√°ji as his deputy, and joining Jagj&iacute;wan
Pav√°r went to Borsad, where he had built a fort. At this time
one J&iacute;vand√°s came with authority from the Niz√°m to
act as collector of Dholka, part of the lands assigned to the
Niz√°m as a personal grant, but failed to enforce his position.
Shortly after this R√°ja &Aacute;nandsing of &Iacute;dar was
killed, and his brother R√°ising, taking leave, went to
&Iacute;dar to settle matters. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n had his patent
increased to the personal rank of commander of 6000 with a contingent
of 6000 cavalry. He received a dress of honour, a jewelled turban, a
plume, six pieces of cloth, an elephant, the order of
M√°hi-mar√°tib,<a class="noteref" id="n325.1src" href="#n325.1" name="n325.1src">58</a> and the title of Najm-ud-daulah
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n Bah√°dur Dil√°war Jang.
Differences again broke out between Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n and
Rangoji, and again matters were settled by a friendly meeting between
the two chiefs at Borsad, where Rangoji had taken up his residence.
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n now went to Petl√°d, and from that to
Cambay, where he was taken ill, but after six weeks came to Vasu, where
Rangoji visited him. Here though again unwell he went to Dholka, and
shortly afterwards he and Rangoji marched upon <span class="corr" id="xd25e30652" title="Source: L&iacute;mbdi">Limb&#7693;i</span>, which
at this time is mentioned as under V&iacute;ramg√°m. While before
<span class="corr" id="xd25e30655" title="Source: L&iacute;mbdi">Limb&#7693;i</span>, Rangoji was summoned by
D√°m√°ji to help him against B√°pu N√°ik, and
at once started to his assistance. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n now marched
into Gohilv√°&#7693;a, and proceeded by Loli√°na to Gogha,
then under the charge of a resident deputy of Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi. Here he received tribute from the chief of Sihor, and from
that, marching into H√°l√°r, went against Nav√°nagar.
<span class="marginnote">The Viceroy collects Tribute in

Kh√°n returned to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. During his
absence in spite of stubborn resistance Nazar &Aacute;li Kh√°n
and Vajer√°m had collected tribute from the Koli chiefs. Rangoji,
who had now left D√°m√°ji, joined battle with B√°pu
N√°ik ere he crossed the Mahi, and B√°pu N√°ik turned
back. Rangoji therefore remained at Borsad, but hearing that
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s illness had become serious, he went
once or twice to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d to visit him.

Muftakhir Kh√°n received an imperial order to carry on the

named &Aacute;nandr√°m, who had been disgraced by Mom&iacute;n

Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n.
Rangoji with this intention invited them both to his house, but his
heart failed him, and shortly afterwards Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n
Kh√°n went to Cambay. Rangoji now determined at all hazards to
assassinate Muftakhir Kh√°n. With this object he took Muftakhir
Kh√°n&rsquo;s associates, Vajer√°m and K√°im
K&uacute;li Kh√°n, into his confidence. Muftakhir Kh√°n
accidentally heard of his designs, and remained on his guard. As
Rangoji had failed to carry out his promise to raise Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi to the post of deputy viceroy, Sher Kh√°n advanced to
Dholka and began plundering some Cambay villages. Rangoji, after
another futile attempt to assassinate Muftakhir Kh√°n, sent for
his deputy R√°m√°ji, who was then in the neighbourhood, and
prepared to fight. <span class="marginnote">Muftakhir Kh√°n

B√°bi deserting the cause of Rangoji, the Mar√°th√°s
were worsted and Rangoji&rsquo;s house was besieged. Rangoji, being
hard pressed, agreed to give up &Aacute;nandr√°m and to surrender
both Borsad and V&iacute;ramg√°m, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi
becoming his security. In this way Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n

<p><span class="marginnote">D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r

of Sher Kh√°n, to escape together with his family.
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n was so greatly enraged with Sher
Kh√°n for this treachery, that Sher Kh√°n leaving
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d on pretence of hunting, escaped to
B√°l√°sinor, where his wife joined him.
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n put &Aacute;nandr√°m to

B√°bi&rsquo;s wife, made good his escape to Borsad.
Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n Kh√°n had set out to collect tribute,
when news arrived that Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, brother
of D√°m√°ji, had crossed the Mahi and joining Rangoji had

He began to aspire to power, and Fid√°-ud-d&iacute;n, who was not
good in the field, had thoughts of appointing him as a deputy. While
matters were in this state, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was
already laying claim to the revenue of the district round

joined by R√°isinghji of &Iacute;dar at Kapadvanj, and, advancing
together, they arrived at Bh&iacute;lpur, eighteen miles east of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. On their approach Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n sent Safdar Kh√°n and <span class="corr" id="xd25e30827" title="Source: Gang√°dar">Gang√°dhar</span> to
oppose them, and the two armies met about six miles from the capital.
After some fighting Fakhr-ud-daulah succeeded in forcing his way to the
suburb of R√°jpura, and next day continuing to drive back the
enemy occupied the suburb of Bahr√°mpura and began the actual
siege of the city. At this point affairs took a turn. Fakhr-ud-daulah
was wounded and returned to his camp, while Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n succeeded in winning over to his side Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi and R√°isinghji of &Iacute;dar, two of the
viceroy&rsquo;s chief supporters. The Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi
especially notes that R√°ja R√°isingh asked for money to
pay his troops but Fakhr-ud-daulah, not knowing that this rule had long
been a dead letter, said that as he held a district on service tenure,
it was not proper for him to ask for a money aid when on imperial
service. <span class="marginnote">Defeat and capture of the Viceroy by

Rangoji with him as far as &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, where he met
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and obtained from Rangoji his share of
the tribute. Khander√°v was not satisfied with Rangoji&rsquo;s
accounts, and appointing a fresh deputy, he attached Rangoji&rsquo;s
property, and before leaving &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d for Sorath,
put him in confinement at Borsad. He also confined Fakhr-ud-daulah in
the Ghi√°spur outpost on the bank of the river Mahi. Meanwhile in
consequence of some misunderstanding between Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n B√°bi and his brother Safdar Kh√°n, the latter
retired to Udepur, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n went to Visalnagar
then in the hands of his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n. From
Visalnagar, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n proceeded to
R√°dhanpur, and meeting his brother Safdar Kh√°n, they
became reconciled, and returned together to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r,
who had in the meantime returned from Sorath, encamping at Dholka
appointed Trimbakr√°v Pandit as his deputy at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d in place of Moro Pandit. On hearing that
Rangoji had been thrown into confinement, Um√°b√°i sent for

pay his troops, he delayed, and afterwards plundered Mahudha and
Na&#7693;i√°d. As Rangoji failed to join him, Sher Kh√°n
proceeded by himself to Kapadvanj, and from Kapadvanj marched against
the Mar√°tha camp, with which Fakhr-ud-daulah was then
associated. On the night after his arrival, the Mar√°th√°s
made an attack on Sher Kh√°n&rsquo;s camp, in which many men on
both sides were slain. Next morning the battle was renewed, but on Sher
Kh√°n suggesting certain terms the fighting ceased. That very
night, hearing that Rangoji had reached B√°l√°sinor, Sher
Kh√°n stole off towards Kapadvanj. Pun√°ji and
Fakhr-ud-daulah followed in pursuit but failed to prevent Rangoji and
Sher Kh√°n from joining their forces.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Siege of Kapadvanj by Fakhr-ud-daulah,

Kh√°n was wounded. He was forced to take shelter with Rangoji in
Kapadvanj, while Fakhr-ud-daulah, Gang√°dhar, and
Krishn√°ji laid siege to that town. At this time the
Lun√°v√°&#7693;a chief asked Malh√°rr√°v Holkar
on his way back from his yearly raid into M√°lwa, to join him in
attacking Virpur. Holkar agreed and Virpur was plundered. Rangoji,
hearing of the arrival of Holkar, begged him to come to his aid, and on
promise of receiving a sum of &pound;20,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 2 <i>l√°khs</i>) and two elephants, Holkar
consented. <span class="marginnote">At the approach of Holkar the Siege

district. Shortly afterwards on a summons from D√°m√°ji and
Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r Rangoji retired to Baroda.
Meanwhile Fakhr-ud-daulah, Krishn√°ji, and Gang√°dhar
advanced to Jetalpur in the Daskroi sub-division of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d and, taking possession of it, expelled
&Aacute;mbar Habshi, the deputy of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n.
D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r passed
from Baroda to Vasu, where they were met by Krishn√°ji and
Gang√°dhar, whom D√°m√°ji censured for aiding
Fakhr-ud-daulah. On this occasion D√°m√°ji bestowed the
districts of Baroda Na&#7693;i√°d and Borsad on his brother
Khander√°v, an action which for ever removed any ill feeling on
the part of Khander√°v. Then, proceeding to Goklej,
D√°m√°ji had an interview with Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n. From Goklej he sent K√°noji T√°kpar with
Fakhr-ud-daulah to Sorath, and himself returned to Songa&#7693;. As
Borsad had been given to Khander√°v, Rangoji fixed on Umreth as
his residence.</p>
<p>In this year, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1746, Teghbeg
Kh√°n, governor of Surat, died, and was succeeded by his brother
Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, who, in acknowledgment of a present of
seven horses, received from the emperor the title of Bah√°dur. At
this time T√°lib &Aacute;li Kh√°n died, and the writer of
the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi was appointed minister by the emperor.
In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1747 Rangoji returned to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n had

as he was not allowed to enter the town he retired. He afterwards went
to Umreth and lived with Rangoji. K√°noji T√°kpar, who had
gone with Fakhr-ud-daulah into Sorath, now laid siege to and took the
town of Vanthali. As it was nearly time for the Mar√°th√°s
to return to their country, K√°noji and Fakhr-ud-daulah, retiring
to Dholka, expelled Muhammad J√°nb√°z, the deputy governor.
Rangoji, who had at this time a dispute with Jaw√°n Mard

plundering the town, they encamped. It was now time for K√°noji

was forced to return unsuccessful. After Teghbeg Kh√°n&rsquo;s
death Sayad Miththan again came to Surat and lived there with his
brother Sayad Achchan, who held the office of paymaster. Sayad Miththan
tried to get the government of the town into his hands, but, again
failing, committed suicide. His brother Sayad Achchan then attacked and
took the citadel, expelling the commander; and for several days war was
waged between him and the governor Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n with
doubtful success. At last Sayad Achchan called to his aid
Malh√°rr√°v, the deputy at Baroda, and their combined
forces took possession of the whole city. During the sack of the city
Malh√°rr√°v was killed and the entire management of affairs
fell into the hands of Sayad Achchan. Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, the
late governor, though obliged to leave the city, was determined not to
give up Surat without a struggle, and raising some men opened fire on
the fort. Sayad Achchan now begged the Arab<span class="corr" id="xd25e30921" title="Not in source">,</span> Turk<span class="corr" id="xd25e30924" title="Not in source">,</span> English<span class="corr"

Varajl√°l his steward to B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa
begged him to include Cambay in his share and send his agent in place
of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s agent.
B√°l√°jir√°v agreed, and from that time an agent of
the Peshwa was established at Cambay. In the same year
Raghun√°thr√°v, brother of the Peshwa, entering
Gujar√°t took possession of the Rewa and Mahi K√°ntha
districts and marched on Surat. Shiaji Dhangar was appointed in
Shevakr√°m&rsquo;s place as D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s deputy,
and Krishn√°ji came to collect the Peshwa&rsquo;s share.</p>

paid the sum of &pound;700 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 7000) for

small cannon. <span class="marginnote">P√°ndurang Pandit Repulsed

Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. During the siege P√°ndurang
Pandit, sending some troops, ravaged N&iacute;kol, part of the lands of
&Aacute;li Muhammad Kh√°n Bah√°dur, the author of the
Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi. Meanwhile, as the operations against
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d made no progress, P√°ndurang

accepted, and on receiving from Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n the
present of a mare and a small sum of money under the name of
entertainment, the Mar√°tha leader withdrew to Sorath.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha Invasion.</span>About this
time the Peshwa released D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r on
his promise to help the Peshwa&rsquo;s brother
Raghun√°thr√°v, who was shortly afterwards despatched with
an army to complete the conquest of Gujar√°t. Meanwhile
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n&rsquo;s anxiety regarding the
Mar√°th√°s was for a time removed by the departure of
P√°ndurang Pandit. And, as the harvest season had arrived, he
with his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi, leaving
Muhammad Mub√°riz Sherw√°ni behind as his deputy, set out
from &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d to levy tribute from the chiefs of
the S√°bar K√°ntha. Certain well informed persons, who had
heard of Raghun√°thr√°v&rsquo;s preparations for invading
Gujar√°t, begged Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n not to leave the
city but to depute his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi
to collect the tribute. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, not believing
their reports, said that he would not go more than from forty-five to
sixty miles from the city, and that, should the necessity of any more
distant excursion arise, he would entrust it to his brother.
<span class="corr" id="xd25e31118" title="Source: J√°wan">Jaw√°n</span> Mard Kh√°n then
marched from the city, levying tribute until he arrived on the
P√°lanpur frontier about seventy-five miles north of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Here meeting Muhammad Bah√°dur
Jh√°lori, the governor of P√°lanpur, Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n was foolishly induced to join him in plundering the fertile
districts of Sirohi, till at last he was not less than 150 miles from
his head-quarters. Meanwhile Raghun√°thr√°v, joining
D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, entered suddenly by an
unusual route into Gujar√°t, and news reached
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d that the Mar√°th√°s had
crossed the Narbada. On this the townspeople sent messenger after
messenger to recall Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and building up the
gateways prepared for defence, while the inhabitants of the suburbs,
leaving their houses, crowded with their families into the city for
protection. Raghun√°thr√°v, hearing that Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n and his army were absent from the city, pressed on by
forced marches, and crossing the river Mahi despatched an advance corps
under Vithal Sukhdev. Kos√°ji, proprietor of Na&#7693;i√°d,
at D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s invitation also
marched towards &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, plundering
Mehm&uacute;d√°b√°d Khokhri, only three miles from the
city. In the meantime Vithal Sukhdev reached Kaira, and taking with him
the chief man of that place, Muhammad Daur√°n, son of Muhammad
B√°bi, continued his march. He was shortly joined by
Raghun√°thr√°v, and the combined forces now proceeded to

to the south-west of the city. Raghun√°thr√°v now proceeded
to invest the city, distributing his thirty to forty thousand horse
into three divisions. The operations against the north of the city were
entrusted to D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r; those on the
east to Gop√°l Hari; while the troops on the south and west were
under the personal command of Raghun√°thr√°v and his
officers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Return of Jaw√°n Mard

M√°ndan by name, who had not left &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
until the arrival of Raghun√°thr√°v at the K√°nkariya
lake, made his way to V√°v and Thar√°d, and told
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n what had happened. Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n set out by forced marches for R√°dhanpur, and leaving
his family and the bulk of his army at P√°tan, he pushed on with
200 picked horsemen to Kadi and from that to
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, contriving to enter the city by night.
<span class="marginnote">He enters
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d.</span>The presence of Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n raised the spirits of the besieged, and the defence was
conducted with ardour. In spite of their watchfulness, a party of about
700 Mar√°th√°s under cover of night succeeded in scaling
the walls and entering the city. Ere they could do any mischief they
were discovered and driven out of the town with much slaughter. The
bulk of the besieging army, which had advanced in hopes that this party
would succeed in opening one of the city gates, were forced to retire
disappointed. Raghun√°thr√°v now made proposals for peace,
but Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n did not think it consistent with his
honour to accept them. On his refusal, the Mar√°tha general
redoubled his efforts and sprung several mines, but owing to the
thickness of the city walls no practicable breach was effected.
Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n now expelled the Mar√°tha deputies,
and <span class="marginnote">Gallant Defence of the

at night to introduce into the town by detachments a great portion of

Surrenders.</span>Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, much against his will,
was forced to enter into negotiations with
Raghun√°thr√°v.</p>
<p>Raghun√°thr√°v was so little hopeful of taking
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d that he had determined, should the siege
last a month longer, to depart on condition of receiving the one-fourth
share of the revenue and a safe conduct. Had Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n only disbursed his own money to pay the troops, and
encouraged instead of disheartening the official class, he need never
have lost the city. At last to Raghun√°thr√°v&rsquo;s
relief, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was reduced to treat for peace
through Vithal Sukhdev. It was arranged that the Mar√°th√°s
should give Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n the sum of &pound;10,000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1 <i>l√°kh</i>) to pay his
troops, besides presenting him with an elephant and other articles of
value. It was at the same time agreed that the garrison should leave
the city with all the honours of war. And that, for himself and his
brothers, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n should receive, free from any
Mar√°tha claim, the districts of P√°tan, Vadnagar, Sami,
Munjpur, Visalnagar, Thar√°d, Kher√°lu, and
R√°dhanpur with Tervada and Bij√°pur. It was further agreed
that one of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n&rsquo;s brothers should
always serve the Mar√°th√°s with 300 horse and 500 foot,
the expenses of the force being paid by the Mar√°th√°s. It
was also stipulated that neither the Peshwa&rsquo;s army nor his
deputy&rsquo;s, nor that of any commander should enter Jaw√°n
Mard Kh√°n&rsquo;s territory, and that in
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d no Mar√°tha official should put up
at any of the Kh√°n Bah√°dur&rsquo;s mansions, new or old,
or at any of those belonging to his brothers followers or servants.
Finally that the estates of other members of the family, namely Kaira,
Kasba M√°tar and B√°nsa Mahudha, which belonged to Muhammad
Kh√°n, Kh√°n Daur√°n, and &Aacute;bid Kh√°n
were not to be meddled with, nor were encroachments to be allowed on
the lands of K√°yam K&uacute;li Kh√°n or of Zor√°war

then marched into Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a to levy tribute
from the Limb&#7693;i and Wadhw√°n chiefs; and was so far
successful that Harbhamji of Limb&#7693;i agreed to pay an annual
tribute of &pound;4000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 40,000). As the
rainy season was drawing near Raghun√°thr√°v returned to

appointed Shevakr√°i to collect his half share of the revenue of
Gujar√°t. <span class="marginnote">Mughal Coinage

to be struck in the emperor&rsquo;s name and the suburbs of the city

Kolis commenced a system of depredation, and their outrages were so
daring that women and children were sometimes carried off and sold as
slaves. After the rains were over (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1754) Shetuji, commander of the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d garrison, and Shankarji, governor of

eighteen miles east of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d,
R√°ghoshankar scattered the Kolis, but they again collected and
forced the Mar√°th√°s to retire. At this time Shetuji and
Shankarji returned from Sorath, where they had performed the pilgrimage
to Dw√°rka. Shetuji was sent to the Bh&iacute;l district against
the Kolis. He was unsuccessful, and was so ashamed of his failure that
he returned to the Dakhan and Dandu D√°t√°tri was appointed
in his place.</p>
<p>In this year died Nek &Aacute;lam Kh√°n II. governor of
Broach. He was succeeded by his brother Khertalab Kh√°n who
expelled his nephew H√°mid Beg, son of Nek &Aacute;lam
Kh√°n. H√°mid Beg took refuge in Surat. At
B√°l√°sinor a dispute arose between Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi and a body of Arab mercenaries who took possession of a
hill, but in the end came to terms. With the Peshwa&rsquo;s permission
his deputy Bhagvantr√°v marched on Cambay. But Varajl√°l,
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s steward, who was then at Poona, sent
word to his master, who prepared himself against any emergency. When
Bhagvantr√°v arrived at Cambay he showed no hostile intentions
and was well received by Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n. Subsequently a
letter from Bhagvantr√°v to S√°lim Jam√°d√°r at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d ordering him to march against Cambay

without success. Eventually Shripatr√°v, the Peshwa&rsquo;s

Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n plundered several Petl√°d villages and
finally, in concert with the Kolis of Dhowan, attacked Jambusar and
carried off much booty. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n next marched against
Borsad, and was on the point of taking the fort when Say√°ji, son
of D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who lived at Baroda,
hearing of Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s success, came rapidly with
a small body of men to the relief of the fort and surprised the

Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was receiving &pound;150 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1500) daily for the pay of his own and his
brother&rsquo;s troops. Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra, considering
the number of the troops too small for so large a payment, reduced the
amount and retained the men in his own service. After a month&rsquo;s
siege, Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s troops began to clamour for
pay, but Shambh&uacute;r√°m, by collecting the sum of
&pound;10,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1 <i>l√°kh</i>)
from the inhabitants of the town managed for the time to appease their
demands. When they again became urgent for pay,
Shambh&uacute;r√°m diverted their thoughts by a general sally
from all the gates at night. On this occasion many men were slain on
both sides, and many of the inhabitants deserted the town. The copper

coined into money and given to the soldiery. In this state of affairs
an order arrived from the imperial court bestowing on Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n a dress of honour and the title of Bah√°dur. Although
the imperial power had for years been merely a name Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n asked and obtained permission from the besiegers to leave
the city and meet the bearers of the order. The Mar√°th√°s
redoubled their efforts. Still though the besiegers were successful in
intercepting supplies of grain the garrison fought gallantly in defence
of the town.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°v of &Iacute;dar helps
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, 1757.</span>At this juncture, in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1757, R√°ja Shivsingh of &Iacute;dar, son
of the late Anandsingh, who was friendly to Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n,
sent Saj√°nsingh Haz√°ri with a force to assist the
besieged. On their way to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d,
Harbhamr√°m with a body of Mar√°th√°s attacked this
detachment, while Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n sent to their aid Muhammad
L√°l Rohilla and others, and a doubtful battle was fought.
Shortly afterwards Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar made an attempt on
the fort of K√°likot. The fort was successfully defended by
Jam√°d√°r N&uacute;r Muhammad, and the
Mar√°th√°s were repulsed. The Mar√°th√°s
endeavoured in vain to persuade Shambh&uacute;r√°m to desert
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, and though the garrison were often endangered
by the faithlessness of the Kolis and other causes, they remained
staunch. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, though frequently in difficulties
owing to want of funds to pay his soldiery, continued to defend the
town. The Mar√°th√°s next tried to seduce some of
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n&rsquo;s officers, but in this they also
failed, and <span class="marginnote">Successful Sally under

<p><span class="marginnote">Negotiations for Peace.</span>When the
siege was at this stage, Hassan K&uacute;li Kh√°n Bah√°dur,
viceroy of Oudh, relinquishing worldly affairs and dividing his
property among his nephews, set out to perform a pilgrimage to Makkah.
Before he started Shuja-&ucirc;d-daulah, the Naw√°b of Lucknow,
requested him on his way to visit B√°l√°jir√°v, and
endeavour to come to some settlement of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d
affairs. Accordingly, adopting the name of Sh√°h N&uacute;r, and
assuming the dress of an ascetic, Hassan K&uacute;li made his way to
Poona, and appearing before the Peshwa offered to make peace at
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Sh√°h N&uacute;r with much
difficulty persuaded the Peshwa to allow Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n to
retain Cambay and Gogha without any Mar√°tha share, and to grant
him a <i>l√°kh</i> of rupees for the payment of his troops, on
condition that he should surrender &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. He
obtained letters from the Peshwa addressed to Sad√°shiv
R√°mchandra to this effect, and set out with them for
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. When he arrived Sad√°shiv
R√°mchandra was unwilling to accede to the terms, as the
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d garrison were reduced to great straits.
Sh√°h N&uacute;r persuaded him at last to agree, provided
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n would surrender without delay. Accordingly
Sh√°h N&uacute;r entered the city and endeavoured to persuade
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n demanded in addition
a few Petl√°d villages, and to this the Mar√°th√°s
refused their consent. Sh√°h N&uacute;r left in disgust. Before
many days Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n was forced to make overtures for
peace. After discussions with D√°m√°ji
G√°ikw√°r, it was agreed that Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n
should surrender the city, receive &pound;10,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1 <i>l√°kh</i>) to pay his soldiery, and be
allowed to retain Cambay as heretofore, that is to say that the Peshwa

and D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r entered the city and

the other chiefs who were engaged in prosecuting the siege,
Sad√°shiv D√°modar returned to the Dakhan and Jaw√°n
Mard Kh√°n receiving some presents from Sad√°shiv
R√°mchandar departed for P√°tan after having had a meeting
with D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r at a village a few
miles from the capital. Shambhur√°m, the N√°gar
Br√°hman, who had so zealously supported Mom&iacute;n
Kh√°n, when he saw that further assistance was useless, tried to
escape, but was taken prisoner and sent in chains to Baroda.
Sad√°shiv R√°mchandar, on taking charge of the city, had
interviews with the principal officials, among whom was the author of
the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi, and, receiving them graciously,
confirmed most of them in their offices. Then, after <span class="corr"

Pandit, brother of P√°ndurang Pandit, to be his deputy in
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, he started on an expedition to collect
tribute in Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a and Sorath.
<span class="marginnote">New Coins.</span>On receiving the government
of the city the Mar√°tha generals ordered new coin bearing the
mark of an elephant goad to be struck in the

G√°ikw√°r remained in &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d on
behalf of his father D√°m√°ji, and shortly afterwards went
towards Kapadvanj to collect tribute. Thence at his father&rsquo;s
request he proceeded to Sorath to arrange for the payment of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share of the revenues of that district.
On his return to Cambay Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n was much harassed by
his troops for arrears of pay. The timely arrival of his steward
Varajl√°l with the Peshwa&rsquo;s contribution of &pound;10,000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1 <i>l√°kh</i>) enabled him to
satisfy their demands.</p>

Nothing was settled as the Mar√°th√°s were forced to return
to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In accordance with orders from the
Peshwa, Shambhur√°m and his sons, who were still in confinement,
were sent to Poona. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r was also
summoned to Poona, but he did not go. In this year R√°o Lakhpat
of Kachh presented Kachh horses and Gujar√°t bullocks to the
emperor, and in return received the title of M&iacute;rza

Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, who was about to visit the Peshwa at Poona,
remained to defend the town, but was forced to pay arrears of tribute
amounting to &pound;2000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 20,000). In

D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r went to Poona, and sent his
son Say√°jir√°v into Sorath. After his success at Cambay
Sad√°shiv R√°mchandra levied tribute from the chiefs of
Umeta, and then returned. On his way back, on account of the opposition
caused by Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n son of Sher Kh√°n
B√°bi, the chief of B√°l√°sinor, Sad√°shiv
R√°mchandar besieged B√°l√°sinor and forced the chief
to pay &pound;3000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 30,000). Next
marching against Lun√°v√°&#7693;a, he compelled the chief
D&iacute;psingh to pay &pound;5000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>
50,000). Sad√°shiv then went to Visalnagar and so to
P√°lanpur, where Muhammad Kh√°n Bah√°dur
Jh√°lori resisted him; but after a month&rsquo;s siege he agreed
to pay a tribute of &pound;3500 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>
35,000). Passing south from P√°lanpur, Sad√°shiv went to
&Uacute;nja-Un√°va, and from that to Katosan where he levied
&pound;1000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 10,000) from the chief
Shuja, and then proceeded to <span class="corr" id="xd25e31443" title="Source: L&iacute;mb&#7693;i">Limb&#7693;i</span>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="sc">Surat Affairs</span>,
1758.</span>During <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1758 important
changes took place in Surat. In the early part of the year Sayad
Mu&icirc;n-ud-d&iacute;n, otherwise called Sayad Achchan, visited the
Peshwa at Poona, and received from him the appointment of governor of
Surat. Sayad Achchan then set out for his charge, and as he was aided
by a body of Mar√°tha troops under the command of Muzaffar
Kh√°n G√°rdi and had also secured the support of
Nekn√°m Kh√°n, the governor of Broach, he succeeded after
some resistance in expelling &Aacute;li Naw√°z Kh√°n, son
of the late Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, and establishing himself in
the government. During the recent troubles, the English factory had
been plundered and two of their clerks murdered by Ahmed Kh√°n
Habshi, commandant of the fort. <span class="marginnote">The English
take command of Surat, 1759.</span>The English therefore determined to
drive out the Habshi and themselves assume the government of the
castle. With this object men-of-war were despatched from Bombay to the
help of Mr. Spencer, the chief of the English factory, and the castle
was taken in March <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1759, and Mr.
Spencer appointed governor. The Peshwa appears to have consented to
this conquest. The Mar√°tha troops aided and made a demonstration
without the city, and a Mar√°tha man-of-war which had been
stationed at Bassein, came to assist the English. A Mr. Glass appears
to have been appointed <i>kiled√°r</i> under Governor
Spencer.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n Visits Poona,

English through Mr. Erskine, the chief of the English factory at
Cambay. Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n then asked Mr. Erskine to obtain
permission for him to go to Poona by Bombay. Leave being granted,
Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n set out for Surat, and was there received by
Mr. Spencer. From Surat he sailed for Bombay, where the governor, Mr.
Bourchier, treating him with much courtesy, informed the Peshwa of his
arrival. The Peshwa sending permission for his further advance to
Poona, Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n took leave of Mr. Bourchier and

advanced against Dhr√°ngadhra, when the chief who was at Halvad
sent an army against him. The Mar√°th√°s, informed of the
chief&rsquo;s design, detaching a force, attacked Halvad at night, and
breaching the walls forced open the gates. The chief retired to his
palace, which was fortified, and there defended himself, but was at
last forced to surrender, and was detained a prisoner until he should
pay a sum of &pound;12,000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1,20,000).
The neighbouring chiefs, impressed with the fate of Halvad, paid
tribute without opposition. <span class="marginnote">The

but ere he could commence operations against the fortress, the rainy

prepared to depart for Poona. Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who
was also in Sorath collecting tribute, amongst other places besieged
Kundla, and levying from that town a tribute of &pound;7500
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 75,000) returned to the capital.
During this time Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r had been
levying tribute from the Kolis, and after visiting the Bh&iacute;l

Na&#7693;i√°d. The chief of Halvad on paying his &pound;12,000
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1,20,000) was allowed to depart, and
D&iacute;psingh of Lun√°v√°&#7693;a, who was also a
prisoner, was sent to Lun√°v√°&#7693;a and there released
after paying his tribute. On receiving the news of the capture of the
Surat fort by the English the emperor issued an order, in the name of
the governor of Bombay, confirming the command of the fort to the
English instead of to the Habshis of Janjira, appointing the Honourable
East India Company admirals of the imperial fleet, and at the same time
discontinuing the yearly payment of &pound;2000 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 20,000) formerly made to the Habshi on this
account. When in the course of the following year, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760, this imperial order reached Surat, Mr.
Spencer and other chief men of the city went outside of the walls to

province, according to the scale of the previous year. Say√°ji
G√°ikw√°r, when Bhagvantr√°v had returned, set out to
Sorath to levy the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share of the tribute.
He was accompanied by Harbhamr√°m whom D√°m√°ji
G√°ikw√°r had specially sent from his own court to act as
K√°md√°r to Say√°ji. When Sad√°shiv
R√°mchandra reported to the Peshwa the conquest of
B√°l√°sinor by Bhagvantr√°v he was highly pleased,
and gave Bhagvantr√°v a dress of honour and allowed him to keep
the elephant which he had captured at Lun√°v√°&#7693;a; and
passed a patent bestowing B√°l√°sinor upon him.

friendly manner to Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, and marching to Cambay, he
fixed the Mar√°tha share of the revenues of that place for that
year at &pound;8400 (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 84,000), and then
went to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d by way of D√°kor.
Narbher√°m collected this year the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s
share of the tribute of Sorath and Say√°ji G√°ikw√°r
went to Baroda. On his return to &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d at the

L&uacute;h√°ra in Bahyal about eighteen miles east of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n now
issued from P√°tan and levied small contributions from the

advantage of the confusion that followed, the Dehli court despatched

directing Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, <span class="corr" id="xd25e31555"
title="Source: J√°wan">Jaw√°n</span> Mard Kh√°n, and
the governor of Broach to join in driving the Mar√°th√°s

Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, defeating the <span class="corr" id="xd25e31558" title="Source: M√°r√°tha">Mar√°tha</span> garrison,
regained B√°l√°sinor, while the governor of Broach, with
the aid of Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, succeeded in winning back
Jamb&uacute;sar. &Aacute;pa Ganesh, the Peshwa&rsquo;s viceroy,
remonstrated with Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n for this breach of faith. In
reply his envoy was shown the despatch received from Dehli, and was
made the bearer of a message, that before it was too late, it would be
wisdom for the Mar√°th√°s to abandon Gujar√°t. Things
were in this state when D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r,
wisely forgetting his quarrels with the Peshwa, marched to the aid of
Sad√°shiv with a large army. Advancing against Cambay he attacked
and defeated Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n, plundering one of his villages.
But the Mar√°th√°s were too weak to follow up this success,
or exact severer punishment from the Musalm√°n confederates.
&Aacute;pa Ganesh invited Sard√°r Muhammad Kh√°n
B√°bi to Kaira, and on condition of the payment of tribute,
agreed to allow him to keep possession of B√°l√°sinor.
Subsequently D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s energy enabled him to enlarge
the power and possessions of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s house,
besides acquisitions from other chiefs, recovering the districts of
Visalnagar, Kher√°lu, Vadnagar, Bij√°pur, and P√°tan
from Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. After the death of the great
D√°m√°ji, the importance of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s power sensibly diminished. Had it not
been for their alliance with the British, the feeble hands of
Say√°jir√°v I. (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1771&ndash;1778) would probably have been the
last to hold the emblem of G√°ikw√°r rule. If in the zenith
of G√°ikw√°r power Mom&iacute;n Kh√°n could

426: Farishtah, I. 503; Elliot, V. 434. In honour of this victory the
Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n built, on the site of the battle, a
palace and garden enclosing all with a high wall. This which he named
J&iacute;tpur the City of Victory was one of the chief ornaments of
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. In November 1613 the English merchant
Wittington writes (Kerr&rsquo;s Voyages, IX. 127): A <i>kos</i> from
Sarkhej is a pleasant house with a large garden all round on the banks
of the river which Chon-Chin-Naw (Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n)
built in honour of a great victory over the last king of
Gujar√°t. No person inhabits the house. Two years later (1615)
another English merchant Dodsworth (Kerr, IX. 203) describes the field
of Victory as strongly walled all round with brick about 1&frac12;
miles in circuit all planted with fruit trees and delightfully watered
having a costly house called by a name signifying Victory in which
Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n for some time resided. In 1618, the
emperor Jeh√°ng&iacute;r (Memoirs Persian Text, 210&ndash;213) on
his way to Sarkhej visited the
Kh√°n-i-Kh√°n√°n&rsquo;s B√°ghi Fateh or Garden
of Victory which he had built at a cost of two <i>l√°khs</i> of
rupees ornamenting the garden with buildings and surrounding it with a
wall. The natives he notices call it Fateh-W√°di. In 1626 the
English traveller Herbert (Travels, 66) writes: Two miles nearer
&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d than Sirkhej are the curious gardens and
palace of Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n where he defeated the last
of the Cambay kings and in memory built a stately house and spacious
gardens the view whereof worthily attracts the traveller. Mandelslo
writing in 1638 is still louder in praise of Tschietb√°g the
Garden of Victory. It is the largest and most beautiful garden in all
India because of its splendid buildings and abundance of fine fruits.
Its site is one of the pleasantest in the world on the border of a
great tank having on the water side many pavilions and a high wall on
the side of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. The lodge and the
caravanserai are worthy of the prince who built them. The garden has
many fruit trees oranges, citrons, pomegranates, dates, almonds,
mulberries, tamarinds, mangoes, and cocoanuts so closely planted that
all walking in the garden is under most pleasing shade
(Mandelslo&rsquo;s Travels, French Ed. 111&ndash;112). When
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1750) the Mir&#259;t-i-&Aacute;hmedi
was written several of the buildings and the remains of the summer
house were still to be seen (Bird&rsquo;s History of Gujar√°t,
375). A few traces of the buildings known as Fateh B√°di or
Victory Garden remains 1879). (&Aacute;hmed√°b√°d

old buildings of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, the emperor (Memoirs,
Persian Text, 208&ndash;210) speaks of the K√°nkariya tank and
its island garden and of the royal palaces in the Bhadar as having
nearly gone to ruin within the last fifty years. He notes that his
Bakhshi had repaired the K√°nkariya tank and that the viceroy
Mukarrab Kh√°n had partly restored the Bhadar palaces against his
arrival. The emperor was disappointed with the capital. After the
accounts he had heard it seemed rather poor with its narrow streets,
its shops with ignoble fronts, and its dust, though to greet the
emperor as he came on elephant-back scattering gold the city and its
population had put on their holiday dress. The emperor speaks (Memoirs,
Persian Text page 211) of having met some of the great men of
Gujar√°t. Chief among these was Sayad Muhammad Bukh√°ri the
representative of Sh√°hi &Aacute;lam and the sons of Sh√°h
Waj&iacute;h-ud-d&iacute;n of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d. They came
as far as Cambay to meet the emperor. After his arrival in the capital

and garden of Sikandar Gujar√°ti the author of the
Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari, to pick some of the author&rsquo;s famous figs
off the trees. Jeh√°ng&iacute;r speaks of the historian as a man
of a refined literary style well versed in all matters of
Gujar√°t history, who six or seven years since had entered his
(the imperial) service (Memoirs, 207&ndash;211). On the occasion of

href="#n279.2src" name="n279.2">32</a></span> The traveller Mandelslo,
who was in &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d in 1638, says: No prince in
Europe has so fine a court as the governor of Gujar√°t. Of none
are the public appearances so magnificent. He never goes out without a
great number of gentlemen and guards on foot and horse. Before him
march many elephants with housings of brocade and velvet, standards,
drums, trumpets, and cymbals. In his palace he is served like a king
and suffers no one to appear before him unless he has asked an
audience. (Travels, French Edition, 151.) Of the general system of
government be says: The viceroy is absolute. It is true he summons
leading lords of the country to deliberate on judgments and important
matters. But they are called to ascertain their views not to adopt
them. On the one hand the king often changes his governors that they
may not grow overpowerful. On the other hand the governors knowing they
may be recalled at any time take immense sums from the rich merchants
especially from the merchants of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d against
whom false charges are brought with the view of forcing them to pay. As
the governor is both civil and criminal judge if the merchants did not
temper his greed they would be ruined beyond remedy. (Ditto, 150.) The
frequent changes of viceroys in Gujar√°t is explained by Terry,
1615&ndash;17 (Voyage to East Indies, 364): To prevent them from
becoming popular the king usually removes his viceroys after one year
sending them to a new government remote from the old one. Terry adds a
curious note: When the king sends any one to a place of government they
never cut their hair till they return into his presence as if they
desired not to appear beautiful except in the king&rsquo;s sight. As
soon as he sees them the king bids them cut their hair (Ditto, 365). It
does not seem to have been cheating to keep up fewer horse than the
number named. Terry (Voyage to East Indies, 391) says: He who hath the
pay of five or six thousand must always have one thousand or more in
readiness according to the king&rsquo;s need of them, and so in
proportion all the rest.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n279.2src">&uarr;</a></p>

him by the prayer of Saint Sh√°h-i-&Aacute;lam. This boy who was
about nine years old died. Malik Seif-ud-d&iacute;n ran to
Sh√°h-i-&Aacute;lam, who used then to live at As√°wal, two
or three miles east of &Aacute;hmed√°b√°d, and in a
transport of grief and rage said to the Saint: &lsquo;Is this the way
you deceive people? Surely you obtained me the gift of that boy to live
and not to die? This I suppose is how you will keep your promise of
mediating for our sinful souls before All√°h also?&rsquo; The
Saint could give no reply and retired to his inner apartments. The
stricken father went to the Saint&rsquo;s son Sh√°h
Bh&iacute;kan, who, going in to his father, entreated him to restore
the Malik&rsquo;s boy to life. The Saint asked his son &lsquo;Are you

&lsquo;I am ready.&rsquo; The Saint, going into an inner room, spread
his skirts before All√°h crying &lsquo;R√°janji,&rsquo; a

Malik on returning to his house found the other half
fulfilled.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n336.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

The Death of Sult√°n Bah√°dur, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1526&ndash;1536.</span> <span class="sc">Colonel
Briggs</span> (Muhammadan Power in India, IV. 132) gives the following
summary of the events which led to the fatal meeting of Sult√°n
Bah√°dur and the Portuguese viceroy Nono da Cunha in the
beginning of 1536&ndash;37:</p>
<p>When in 1529 Nono daCunha came as viceroy to India he held
instructions to make himself master of the island of Diu. In the
following year a great expedition, consisting of 400 vessels and 15,600
men, met in Bombay and sailed to the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a coast. After vigorous assaults it
was repulsed off Diu on the 17th February 1531. From that day the
Portuguese made ceaseless efforts to obtain a footing on the island of
Diu. In 1531 besides harrying the sea trade of Gujar√°t the
Portuguese sacked the towns of T√°r√°pur, Bals√°r,
and Surat, and, to give colour to their pretensions, received under
their protection Ch√°nd Kh√°n an illegitimate brother of
Bah√°dur. In 1532, under James de Silveira, the Portuguese burned
the south K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a ports of
Pattan-Somn√°th, Mangrul, Tal√°ja, and
Muzaffar√°b√°d, killing many of the people and carrying off
4000 as slaves. Shortly after the Portuguese took and destroyed Bassein
in Th√°na obtaining 400 cannon and much ammunition. They also
burned Daman, Th√°na, and Bombay. &ldquo;All this&rdquo; says the
Portuguese historian &ldquo;they did to straiten Diu and to oblige the
king of Gujar√°t to consent to their raising a fort on the island
of Diu.&rdquo; When Bah√°dur was engaged with the Mughals
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1532&ndash;1534) the Portuguese
Governor General deputed an embassy to wait on Hum√°y&uacute;n to
endeavour to obtain from him the cession of Diu, hoping by this action
to work indirectly on the fears of Bah√°dur. At last in 1534
Bah√°dur consented to a peace by which he agreed to cede the town
of Bassein to Portugal; not to construct ships of war in his ports; and
not to combine with Turkish fleets against Portugal.</p>
<p>Permission was also given to the Portuguese to build in Diu. In
consideration of these terms the Portuguese agreed to furnish
Bah√°dur with 500 Europeans of whom fifty were men of note.
According to the Portuguese historian it was solely because of this
Portuguese help that Bah√°dur succeeded in driving the Mughals
out of Gujar√°t. Bah√°dur&rsquo;s cession of land in Diu to
the Portuguese was for the purpose of building a mercantile factory.
From the moment Bah√°dur discovered they had raised formidable
fortifications, especially when by the withdrawal of the Mughals he no
longer had any motive for keeping on terms with them, he resolved to
wrest the fort out of the hands of the Portuguese. On the plea of
separating the natives from the Europeans, Bah√°dur instructed
his governor of Diu to build a wall with a rampart capable of being
mounted with guns. But as this created much dispute and ill-will the
rampart was given up. Bah√°dur next attempted to seize Emanuel de
Souza the captain of Diu fort. With this object he invited DeSouza to
his camp. DeSouza was warned but determined to accept
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s invitation. He went attended by only one
servant, an act of courage which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348"
href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix I.<br>
The Death of Sult√°n Bah√°dur, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1526&ndash;1536.</span> Bah√°dur so greatly
admired that he treated him with honour and allowed him to return in
safety. Bah√°dur next schemed to secure DeSouza in the fort by
surprise. With this end he began to pay the Portuguese officers visits
at all hours. But DeSouza was always on his guard and
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s surprise visits failed to give him an
opportunity. In 1536 DeSouza wrote to the viceroy complaining of the
bad feeling of the Gujar√°t Moors towards the Portuguese in Diu
and of the efforts of the king to drive them out of the fort. In
consequence of DeSouza&rsquo;s letter Nono daCunha the viceroy arrived
at Diu early in 1536&ndash;7. Bah√°dur went to visit the viceroy
on board the viceroy&rsquo;s ship. On his return he was attacked and
leaping into the water was killed by a blow on the head and sank.</p>
<p>Of the unplanned and confused circumstances in which the brave
Bah√°dur met his death four Musalm√°n and four Portuguese
versions remain. The author of the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian
Text, 280&ndash;281) states that the Portuguese, who offered their help
to Bah√°dur in the days of his defeat by the emperor
Hum√°y&uacute;n, obtained from him the grant of land at Diu, and
on this land built a fort. After the re-establishment of his power the
Sult√°n, who had no longer any need of their help, kept
constantly planning some means of ousting the Portuguese from Diu. With
this object Bah√°dur came to Diu and opened negotiations with the
Portuguese viceroy, hoping in the end to get the viceroy into his
power. The viceroy knowing that Bah√°dur regretted the
concessions he had made to them was too wary to place himself in
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s hands. To inspire confidence Bah√°dur,
with five or six of his nobles all unarmed, paid the viceroy a visit on
board his ship. Suspecting foul play from the behaviour of the
Portuguese the king rose to retire, but the Portuguese pressed upon him
on all sides. He had nearly reached his boat when one of the Portuguese
struck him a blow with a sword, killed him, and threw his body
overboard.</p>
<p>The same author gives a second version which he says is more
generally received and is probably more accurate. According to this
account the Portuguese had come to know that Bah√°dur had invited
the Sult√°ns of the Dakhan to co-operate with him in driving the
Portuguese from the Gujar√°t, Konkan, and Dakhan ports. That the
Portuguese viceroy had come with 150 ships and had anchored at Diu off
the chain bastion. That Sult√°n Bah√°dur not suspecting
that the Portuguese were aware of his insincerity went in a barge to
see the fleet, and when he got in the midst of their ships, the
Portuguese surrounded his barge and killed him with lances.</p>
<p>According to Farishtah (II. 442, 443, <abbr title="Persian">Pers.</abbr> Text) on the invasion of Gujar√°t by the
emperor Hum√°y&uacute;n, Sult√°n Bah√°dur had asked
help of the Portuguese. When his power was re-established,
Bah√°dur, hearing of the arrival of between five and six thousand
Portuguese at Diu, feared they would take possession of that port. He
therefore hastened to Diu from <span class="corr" id="xd25e31623"
title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span>.
The Portuguese who were aware that Hum√°y&uacute;n had withdrawn
and that Bah√°dur had re-established his power, preferred to
attempt to gain Diu by stratagem rather than by force. Bah√°dur
asked the viceroy to visit him. The viceroy feigned sickness and
Bah√°dur with the object of proving his goodwill offered to visit
the viceroy on board his ship. On leaving the viceroy&rsquo;s ship to
enter his own barge the Portuguese suddenly moved their vessel and
Bah√°dur fell overboard. While in the water a Portuguese struck
the king with a lance and killed him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>

Bah√°dur&rsquo;s impetuous vigour and bravery than either the
Gujar√°t or Farishtah&rsquo;s narratives. The Portuguese chief
was apprehensive that as the Sult√°n was no longer in want of
assistance he meditated treachery. So he sent to inform the
Sult√°n that he had come as requested, but that he was ill and
unable to go on shore, so that the interview must be deferred till he
got better. The Sult√°n, quitting the royal road of safety,
embarked on the 12th February 1536 (3rd Ramazan H. 943) with a small
escort to visit the viceroy on board the viceroy&rsquo;s ship. As soon
as Bah√°dur reached the vessel he found the viceroy&rsquo;s
sickness was a pretence and regretted that he had come. He at once
sought to return. But the Portuguese were unwilling that such a prey
should escape them and hoped that by keeping him prisoner they might
get more ports. The viceroy came forward and asked the Sult√°n to
stay a little and examine some curiosities he had to present. The
Sult√°n replied that the curiosities might be sent after him and
turned quickly towards his own boat. A European <i>k√°zi</i> or
priest placed himself in the Sult√°n&rsquo;s way and bade him
stop. The Sult√°n, in exasperation, drew his sword and cleft the
priest in twain. He then leaped into his own boat. The Portuguese
vessels drew round the Sult√°n&rsquo;s boat and a fight began.
The Sult√°n and R&uacute;mi Kh√°n threw themselves into the
water. A friend among the Portuguese stretched a hand to R&uacute;mi
Kh√°n and saved him: the Sult√°n was drowned in the
waves.</p>
<p>Of the four Portuguese versions of Bah√°dur&rsquo;s death the
first appears in Correa&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1512&ndash;1550) Lendas Da Asia, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1497 to 1550; the second in DeBarros&rsquo; (died
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1570) Decadas, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1497 to 1539; the third in Do Couto&rsquo;s (died
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1600&nbsp;?) continuation of
DeBarros, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1529 to 1600; and the
fourth in Faria-e-Souza&rsquo;s (died <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1650) Portuguese Asia to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1640. A fifth reference to Bah√°dur&rsquo;s
death will be found in Castaneda&rsquo;s <span lang="pt">Historia</span> which extends to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1538.</p>
<p>As Correa was in India from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1512
till his death in Goa in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1550, and as
his narrative which was never published till <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1856&ndash;64 has the highest reputation for
accuracy of detail his version carries special weight. According to
Correa (<span lang="pt">Lendas Da Asia</span>, Vol. III. <abbr title="Chapter">Chap.</abbr> XCV.) during the monsoon of 1536, Nono DaCunha
the viceroy received by land a letter from Manoel deSouza the captain
of Diu fort, telling him of the discontent of the Gujar√°t Moors
with king Bah√°dur for allowing the Portuguese to build a fort at
Diu. In consequence of this information early in the fair season Nono
daCunha sailed from Goa in his own galleon accompanied by about ten
small vessels <i>fustas</i> and <i>katurs</i> under the command of
Antonio deSylveira. Nono reached Diu about the end of December. King
Bah√°dur was glad that the viceroy should come to Diu almost
alone since it seemed to show he was not aware of
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s designs against the Portuguese. When
Bah√°dur arrived at Diu he sent a message to the viceroy inviting
him to come ashore to meet him as he had important business to
transact. The king&rsquo;s messenger found the viceroy ill in bed, and
brought back a message that the viceroy would come ashore to meet the
king in the evening. Immediately after the king&rsquo;s messenger left,
Manoel deSouza, the captain of Diu fort, came on board to see the
viceroy. The viceroy told Manoel to go and thank the king and to return
his visit. The king expressed his grief at the viceroy&rsquo;s illness
and proposed to start at once to see him. He went to his barge and
rowed straight to the viceroy&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix I.<br>
The Death of Sult√°n Bah√°dur, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1526&ndash;1536.</span> galleon. The king had
with him, besides the interpreter St. Jago, seven men and two pages one
carrying a sword and the other a bow. The captain of the fort and some
other officers in their own barges followed the king. Bah√°dur,
who was the first to arrive, came so speedily that the viceroy had
hardly time to make preparations to receive him. He put on heavy
clothes to show he was suffering from ague and ordered all the officers
to be well armed. When Bah√°dur came on board he saw the men busy
with their weapons but showed no signs that he suspected foul play. He
went straight to the viceroy&rsquo;s cabin. The viceroy tried to get up
but Bah√°dur prevented him, asked how he was, and returned at
once to the deck. As Bah√°dur stood on the deck the captain of
the fort boarded the galleon, and, as he passed to the cabin to see the
viceroy, Bah√°dur laughingly upbraided him with being behind
time. Then without taking leave of the viceroy Bah√°dur went to
his barge. When the viceroy learned that the king had left he told the
captain to follow the king and to take him to the fort and keep him
there till the viceroy saw him. The captain rowed after the king who
was already well ahead. He called to the king asking him to wait. The
king waited. When the captain came close to the king&rsquo;s barge he
asked the king to come into his vessel. But the interpreter without
referring to the king replied that the captain should come into the
king&rsquo;s barge. DeSouza ordered his boat alongside. His barge
struck the king&rsquo;s barge and DeSouza who was standing on the poop
tripped and fell into the water. The rowers of the royal barge picked
him out and placed him near the king who laughed at his wet clothes.
Other Portuguese barges whose officers thought the Moors were fighting
with the captain began to gather. The first to arrive was Antonio
Cardoza. When Cardoza came up the interpreter told the king to make for
land with all speed as the Portuguese seemed to be coming to seize and
kill him. The king gave the order to make for the shore. He also told
the page to shoot the hollow arrow whose whistling noise was a danger
signal. When the Moors in the king&rsquo;s barge heard the whistle they
attacked Manoel deSouza, who fell dead into the sea. Then Diogo de
Mesquita, D&rsquo;Almeida, and Antonio Correa forced their way on to
the king&rsquo;s barge. When the king saw them he unsheathed his sword
and the page shot an arrow and killed Antonio Cardoza, who fell
overboard and was drowned. D&rsquo;Almeida was killed by a sword-cut
from a Moor called Tiger and Tiger was killed by Correa. At that moment
Diogo de Mesquita gave the king a slight sword-cut and the king jumped
into the sea. After the king, the interpreter and R&uacute;mi
Kh√°n, two Moors, and all the rowers leapt into the water. The
Portuguese barges surrounded them and the men struck at the three
swimmers with lances and oars. The king twice cried aloud &lsquo;I am
Sult√°n Bah√°dur,&rsquo; hoping that some one would help
him. A man who did not know that he was the king struck Bah√°dur
on the head with a club. The blow was fatal and Bah√°dur sank.
The second version is given by Barros (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1560) in his Decadas da Asia, Vol. V. page 357 of
the 1707 edition. The third version by Do Couto (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1600) in his continuation of Barros&rsquo;
Decadas, and the fourth by Faria-e-Souza (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1650) in his Portuguese Asia are in the main
taken from De Barros. The following details are from Steevens&rsquo;
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1697) translation of Faria given in
Briggs&rsquo; Muhammadan Power in India, IV. 135&ndash;138.</p>
<p>Bah√°dur king of Cambay, who had recovered his kingdom solely
by the assistance of the Portuguese, now studied their ruin, and
repenting of the leave he had granted to build a fort at Diu
endeavoured to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

The Death of Sult√°n Bah√°dur, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1526&ndash;1536.</span> take it and to kill the
commander and the garrison. Nono da Cunha the Portuguese viceroy
understood his designs and prepared to prevent them. Emanuel deSouza
who commanded at Diu was warned by a Moor that the king would send for
him by a certain Moor and kill him. DeSouza determined to go, and, when
sent for, appeared with only one servant. Admiring DeSouza&rsquo;s
courage the king treated him honourably and allowed him to return in
safety. The king&rsquo;s mother tried to dissuade her son from plotting
against DeSouza but to no effect. To remove suspicion Bah√°dur
began to pay the Portuguese officers visits at unseasonable hours, but
was ever received by DeSouza on his guard. Meanwhile, on the 9th
January 1536, Nono daCunha the Portuguese viceroy set out from Goa for
Diu with 300 sail. When he put in at Cheul he found
Niz√°m-ul-Mulk who pretended he had come to divert his women at
sea but really with designs on that place. When Nono reached Diu the
king was hunting in the mountains and Nono apprised him of his arrival.
The king sent for him by a Portuguese apostate of the name of John de
St. Jago called Firangi Kh√°n, but Nono daCunha pleaded illness.
The king pretending great friendship came to Diu accompanied by Emanuel
deSouza, who had brought the last message from DaCunha. At Diu the king
went on board the viceroy&rsquo;s ship and for a time they discoursed.
The king was troubled at a page whispering something to DaCunha, but as
DaCunha took no notice his suspicions were allayed. The message was
from DeSouza, stating that the captains whom he had summoned were
awaiting orders to secure or kill the king. DaCunha thought it strange
that DeSouza had not killed the king while he was in his power in the
fort; and DeSouza thought it strange that DaCunha did not now seize the
king when he was in his power in the ship. DaCunha directed all the
officers to escort the king to the palace and then accompany DeSouza to
the fort, where DaCunha intended to seize the king when he came to
visit him. The king on his part had resolved to seize DaCunha at a
dinner to which he had invited him and send him in a cage to the Great
Turk. De Souza who was going to invite the king to the fort after
DaCunha had entered it, came up with the king&rsquo;s barge and
delivered his invitation through R&uacute;mi Kh√°n. R&uacute;mi
Kh√°n warned the king not to accept it. The king disregarding
this warning invited DeSouza into his barge. While stepping into the
king&rsquo;s barge DeSouza fell overboard, but was picked up by
officers who carried him to the king. At this time three Portuguese
barges came up and some of the officers seeing DeSouza hastily enter
the king&rsquo;s barge drew close to the king&rsquo;s barge. The king
remembering R&uacute;mi Kh√°n&rsquo;s warning ordered Emanuel
deSouza to be killed. James <span class="corr" id="xd25e31745" title="Source: deMesquita">de Mesquita</span> understanding the order flew at
and wounded the king. An affray followed and four Portuguese and seven
of the king&rsquo;s men were killed. The king tried to get away in a
boat but a cannon shot killed three of his rowers and he was stopped.
He next attempted to escape by swimming, but being in danger of
drowning discovered himself by crying for help. A Portuguese held out
an oar to him; but others struck him fatal blows, so that he sank.</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn from these four Musalm√°n and four
Portuguese versions is that on either side the leader hoped by some
future treachery to seize the person of the other; and that mutual
suspicion turned into a fatal affray a meeting which both parties
intended should pass peacefully and lull the other into a false and
favourable security. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"

Appendix II.<br>
The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">Description.</span></i></span> M√°ndu, about
twenty-three miles south of Dh√°r in Central India, is a wide
waving hill-top, part of the great wall of the Vindhyan range. The
hill-top is three to four miles from north to south and four to five
miles from east to west. On the north, the east, and the west,
M√°ndu is islanded from the main plateau of M√°lwa by
valleys and ravines that circle round to its southern face, which
stands 1200 feet out of the N&iacute;m√°r plain. The area of the
hill-top is over 12,000 English acres, and, so broken is its outline,
that the encircling wall is said to have a length of between
thirty-seven and thirty-eight miles. Its height, 1950 feet above the
sea, secures for the hill-top at all seasons the boon of fresh and cool
air.</p>
<p>About twenty miles south of Dh√°r the level cultivated plateau
breaks into woody glades and uplands. Two miles further the plain is
cleft by two great ravines, which from their deeper and broader
southern mouths 700 to 800 feet below the Dh√°r plateau, as they
wind northwards, narrow and rise, till, to the north of M√°ndu
hill, they shallow into a woody dip or valley about 300 yards broad and
200 feet below the south crest of M√°lwa. From the south crest of
the M√°lwa plateau, across the tree tops of this wild valley,
stand the cliffs of the island M√°ndu, their crests crowned by
the great Dehli gateway and its long lofty line of flanking walls. At
the foot of the sudden dip into the valley the &Acirc;lamg&iacute;r or
World-Guarding Gate stands sentinel.<a class="noteref" id="n352.1src"
href="#n352.1" name="n352.1src">1</a> Beyond the gateway, among wild
reaches of rock and forest, a noble causeway with high domed tombs on
either hand fills the lowest dip of the valley. From the south end of
the causeway the road winds up to a second gateway, and beyond the
second gateway between side walls climbs till at the crest of the slope
it passes through the ruined but still lofty and beautiful Dehli or
northern gateway, one of the earliest works of Dil√°war
Kh√°n (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1400), the founder of
Musalm√°n M√°ndu.</p>
<p>Close inside of the Dehli gate, on the right or west, stands the
handsome Hindola Palace. The name Hindola, which is probably the title
of the builder, is explained by the people as the Swingcot palace,
because, like the sides of the cage of a swinging cot, the walls of the
hall bulge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix II.<br>
The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">Description.</span></i></span> below and narrow
towards the top. Its great baronial hall and hanging windows give the
Hindola palace a special merit and interest, and an air of lordly
wealth and luxury still clings to the tree-covered ruins which stretch
west to large underground cisterns and hot weather retreats. About a
quarter of a mile south stand the notable group of the Jah√°z
Mehel or Ship palace on the west, and the Tapela Mehel or Caldron
palace on the south, with their rows of lofty pointed arches below deep
stone caves, their heavy windowless upper stories, and their massive
arched and domed roof chambers. These palaces are not more handsomely
built than finely set. The massive ship-like length of the Jah√°z
Mehel lies between two large tree-girt ponds, and the Tapela, across a
beautiful foreground of water and ruin, looks east into the mass of
tangled bush and tree which once formed part of the 130 acres of the
L√°l B√°gh or Royal Gardens.</p>
<p>The flat palace roofs command the whole 12,000 acres of M√°ndu
hill, north to the knolls and broken uplands beyond the great
ravine-moat and south across the waving hill-top with its miles of
glades and ridges, its scattered villages hamlets and tombs, and its
gleaming groves of mangoes, <i>khirnis</i>, banyans, <i>mhowras</i>,
and <i>pipals</i>. In the middle distance, out from the tree-tops,
stand the lofty domes of Hoshang&rsquo;s tomb and of the great
J√°m√° mosque. Further south lies the tree-girt hollow of
the S√°gar Tal√°v or Sea Lake, and beyond the S√°gar
lake a woody plateau rises about 200 feet to the southern crest, where,
clear against the sky, stand the airy cupolas of the pavilion of
R&uacute;p Mati, the beautiful wife of B√°z Bah√°dur
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1551&ndash;1561), the last
Sult√°n of M√°lwa. Finally to the west, from the end of the
R&uacute;p Mati heights, rises even higher the bare nearly isolated
shoulder of Songad, the citadel or inner fort of M√°ndu, the
scene of the Gujar√°t Bah√°dur&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1531) daring and successful surprise. This fair
hill-top, beautiful from its tangled wildness and scattered ruins, is a
strange contrast to M√°ndu, the capital of a warlike independent
dynasty. During the palmy days of the fifteenth century, of the 12,000
acres of the M√°ndu hill-top, 560 were fields, 370 were gardens,
200 were wells, 780 were lakes and ponds, 100 were baz√°r roads,
1500 were dwellings, 200 were rest-houses, 260 were baths, 470 were
mosques, and 334 were palaces. These allotments crowded out the wild to
a narrow pittance of 1560 acres of knolls and ridges.</p>
<p>From the Jah√°z Mehel the road winds through fields and woods,
gemmed with peafowl and droll with monkeys, among scattered palaces
mosques and tombs, some shapely some in heaps, about a mile south to
the walled enclosure of the lofty domed tomb of the establisher of
M√°ndu&rsquo;s greatness, Hoshang Sh√°h Ghori (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1405&ndash;1432). Though the badly-fitted
joinings of the marble slabs of the tomb walls are a notable contrast
to the finish of the later Mughal buildings, Hoshang&rsquo;s tomb, in
its massive simplicity and dim-lighted roughness, is a solemn and
suitable resting-place for a great Path√°n warrior. Along the
west of the tomb enclosure runs a handsome flat-roofed colonnade. The
pillars, which near the base are four-sided, pass through an
eight-sided and a sixteen-sided belt into a round upper shaft. The
round shaft ends in a square under-capital, each face of which is
filled by a group of leafage in outline the same as the favourite Hindu
<i>Singh-m&uacute;kh</i> or horned face. Over the entwined leafy horns
of this moulding, stone brackets support heavy stone beams, all Hindu
in pattern.<a class="noteref" id="n353.1src" href="#n353.1" name="n353.1src">2</a> Close to the east of Hoshang&rsquo;s tomb is

Masjid or Great Mosque, built of blocks of red limestone.
Hoshang&rsquo;s mosque is approached from the east through a massive
domed gateway and across a quadrangle enclosed on the east north and
south by wrecked colonnades of pointed arches. The west is filled by
the great pointed arches of the mosque in fair repair. On the roof of
the mosque from a thick undergrowth of domelets rise three lofty
domes.<a class="noteref" id="n354.1src" href="#n354.1" name="n354.1src">3</a></p>
<p>In front of the gateway of the Great Mosque, in the centre of a
masonry plinth about three feet high, stands an iron pillar about a
foot in diameter at the base and twenty feet high. Close to the east of
the gateway is the site of Mehm&uacute;d&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1442) Tower of Victory, traces of which remained
as late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1840. About fifty yards
further east are the ruins of a great building called the Ashrafi
Mehel, said to have been a Musalm√°n college. To the north-east a
banner marks a temple and the local state offices. South the road
passes between the two lines of small houses and huts that make modern
M√°ndu. Beyond the village, among ruins and huge swollen baobab
stems, the road winds south along a downward slope to the richly-wooded
lowland, where stretches to the west the wide coolness of the
S√°gar Tal√°v or Sea lake. Its broad surface covering 600
acres is green with fanlike lotus leaves, reeds, and water-grasses. Its
banks are rough with brakes of tangled bush from which, in uncramped
stateliness, rise lofty <i>mhauras</i>, mangoes, <i>kirnis</i>, and
<i>p&iacute;pals</i>. To the east round a smaller tank, whose banks are
crowned by splendid mangoes and tamarinds, stand the domes of several
handsome tombs. Of some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">Description.</span></i></span> of these domes the
black masses are brightened by belts of brilliant pale and deep-blue
enamel. To the north of this overflow-pool a long black wall is the
back of the smaller J√°m√° or congregation mosque, badly
ruined, but of special interest, as each of its numerous pillars shows
the uninjured Hindu <i>Singh-m&uacute;kh</i> or horned face. By a rough
piece of constructive skill the original cross corners of the end
cupolas have been worked into vaulted Musalm√°n domes.<a class="noteref" id="n355.1src" href="#n355.1" name="n355.1src">4</a></p>
<p>From the Sea Lake, about a mile across the waving richly-wooded
plain, bounded by the southern height of the plateau, the path leads to
the sacred Rewa Kund or Narbada Pool, a small shady pond lined with
rich masonry, and its west side enriched by the ruins of a handsome
Bath or Hamm√°m Kh√°nah. From the north-east corner of the
Rewa Pool a broad flight of easy stairs leads thirty or forty feet up
the slope on whose top stands the palace of B√°z Bah√°dur
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1551&ndash;1561) the last
independent chief of M√°ndu.<a class="noteref" id="n355.2src"
href="#n355.2" name="n355.2src">5</a> The broad easy flight of steps
ends in a lofty arched gateway through which a roomy hall or passage
gives entrance into a courtyard with a central masonry cistern and an
enclosing double colonnade, which on the right opens into an arched
balcony overlooking the Rewa Kund and garden. Within this courtyard is
a second court enclosed on three sides by an arched gallery. The roof
of the colonnades, which are reached by flights of easy steps, are
shaded by arched pavilions topped by cupolas brightened by belts of
blue enamel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix II.<br>
The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">Description.</span></i></span> To the south of
B√°z Bah√°dur&rsquo;s Palace a winding path climbs the
steep slope of the southern rim of M√°ndu to the massive pillared
cupolas of R&uacute;p Mati&rsquo;s palace, which, clear against the
sky, are the most notable ornament of the hill-top. From a ground floor
of heavy masonry walls and arched gateways stairs lead to a flat
masonry terrace. At the north and south ends of the terrace stand
massive heavy-eaved pavilions, whose square pillars and pointed arches
support lofty deep-grooved domes. The south pavilion on the crest of
the Vindhyan cliff commands a long stretch of the south face of
M√°ndu with its guardian wall crowning the heights and hollows of
the hill-top. Twelve hundred feet below spreads the dim hazy
N&iacute;m√°r plain brightened eastwards by the gleaming coil of
the Narbada. The north pavilion, through the clear fresh air of the
hill-top, looks over the entire stretch of M√°ndu from the high
shoulder of Songad in the extreme south-west across rolling
tree-brightened fields, past the domes, the tangled bush, and the broad
gray of the Sea Lake, to the five-domed cluster of Hoshang&rsquo;s
mosque and tomb, on, across a sea of green tree tops, to the domed
roof-chambers of the Jah√°z and Tapela palaces, through the Dehli
gateway, and, beyond the deep cleft of the northern ravine, to the bare
level and the low ranges of the M√°lwa plain.</p>
<p>From the Rewa Pool a path, along the foot of the southern height
among noble solitary <i>mhauras</i> and <i>khirnis</i>, across fields
and past small clusters of huts, guides to a flight of steps which lead
down to a deep shady rock-cut dell where a Muhammadan chamber with
great open arched front looks out across a fountained courtyard and
sloping scalloped water table to the wild western slopes of
M√°ndu. This is Nilkanth, where the emperor Akbar lodged in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1574, and which
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r visited in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1617.<a class="noteref" id="n356.1src" href="#n356.1" name="n356.1src">6</a></p>
<p>From the top of the steps that lead to the dell the hill stretches
west bare and stony to the Songad or T√°r√°p&uacute;r
gateway on the narrow neck beyond which rises the broad shoulder of
Songad, the lofty south-west limit of the M√°ndu
hill-top.<a class="noteref" id="n356.2src" href="#n356.2" name="n356.2src">7</a></p>

a gate at the entrance to Songa&#7693;h, the south-west corner and
citadel of M√°ndu, afterwards known as the
T√°r√°p&uacute;r Gate.</p>
<p>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1398 Alp Kh√°n, son of
Dil√°war Kh√°n, annoyed with his father for entertaining as
his overlord at Dh√°r Mehm&uacute;d Tughlak, the refugee monarch
of Dehli, withdrew to M√°ndu. He stayed in M√°ndu for three
years, laying, according to Farishtah, the foundation of the famous
fortress of solid masonry which was the strongest fortification in that
part of the world.<a class="noteref" id="n358.1src" href="#n358.1"

Sult√°n Hoshang, and moved the capital to M√°ndu. The
rumour that Hoshang had poisoned his father gave Dil√°war&rsquo;s
brother in arms, Muzaffar Sh√°h of Gujar√°t (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1399&ndash;1411), an excuse for an expedition
against Hoshang.<a class="noteref" id="n358.2src" href="#n358.2" name="n358.2src">15</a> Hoshang was defeated at Dh√°r, made prisoner,

appointed in his place. Nasrat failed to gain the goodwill either of
the people or of the army of M√°lwa; and was forced to retire
from Dh√°r and take refuge in M√°ndu. In consequence of
this failure in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1408, at
Hoshang&rsquo;s request Muzaffar set Hoshang free after a year&rsquo;s

went disguised as a horse-dealer to J√°jnagar (now J√°jpur)

horses, of which he had heard the R√°ja was very fond. His object
was to barter these horses and other goods for the famous war elephants
of J√°jnagar. An accident in the camp of the disguised merchants
led to a fight, in which the R√°ja was taken prisoner and Hoshang

Mehm&uacute;d Kh√°n, M√°lwa prospered and Hoshang&rsquo;s
power was extended. Hoshang enriched his capital with buildings, among
them the Great Mosque and his own tomb, both of which he left

appears to have built the assembly mosque near the S√°gar Lake in

on the left bank of the Narbada, about 120 miles east of M√°ndu,
Hoshang, who was suffering from diabetes, took greatly to heart the
fall of a ruby out of his crown. He said: A few days before the death
of F&iacute;r&uacute;z Tughlak a jewel dropped from his crown. Hoshang
ordered that he should be taken to M√°ndu. Before he had gone
many miles the king died. His nobles carried the body to the Madrasah
or college in Sh√°di√°b√°d or M√°ndu, and
buried him in the college on the ninth day of Zil Hajjah, the twelfth
month of <span class="sc">a.h.</span>&nbsp;838 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1434. The year of Hoshang&rsquo;s death is to be

years (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1436&ndash;1469) of untiring
energy and activity Mehm&uacute;d died. Farishtah says of him:
&ldquo;His tent was his home: the field of battle his resting-place. He
was polite, brave, just, and learned. His Hindu and Musalm√°n
subjects were happy and friendly. He guarded his lands from invaders.
He made good his loss to any one who suffered from robbery in his
dominions, recovering the amount from the village in whose lands the
robbery had taken place, a system which worked so well that theft and
robbery became almost unknown. Finally, by a systematic effort he freed
the country from the dread of wild beasts.<span class="corr" id="xd25e32647" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="n362.5src" href="#n362.5" name="n362.5src">43</a></p>

skill as a soldier much of Mehm&uacute;d&rsquo;s success had been due.
On his accession Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n made his son Abdul

The M√°lwa Sult√°ns, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1400&ndash;1570.</span> which surround it. It
seems probable that the Tapela Palace close to the south-east of the
Ship palace and the lake and royal gardens immediately to the north and
north-east of the Tapela palace were part of
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s pleasure-houses and grounds. The
scale of the ruins behind the Hindola or Swingcot palace to the north,
and their connection with the out-buildings to the west of the
Jah√°z Mehel, suggest that they also belonged to the palaces and
women&rsquo;s quarters of the pleasure-loving
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n.</p>
<p>Of the surprising size and fantastic arrangements of
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s pleasure city, the true M√°ndu
Sh√°di√°b√°d or Abode of Joy, curious details have
been preserved. This Abode of Pleasure was a city not a palace. It
contained 15,000 inhabitants, all of them women, none either old or
plain-featured, and each trained to some profession or craft. Among
them were the whole officers of a court, besides courtiers, teachers,
musicians, dancers, prayer-readers, embroiderers, and followers of all
crafts and callings. Whenever the king heard of a beautiful girl he
never rested till he obtained her. This city of women had its two
regiments of guards, the Archers and the Carabineers, each 500 strong,
its soldiers dressed like men in a distinguishing uniform. The archers
were beautiful young Turk&iacute; damsels, all armed with bows and
arrows: the carabineers were Abyssinian maidens, each carrying a
carbine. Attached to the palace and city was a deer park, where the
Lord of Leisure used to hunt with his favourites. Each dweller in the
city of women received her daily dole of grain and coppers, and besides
the women were many pensioners, mice<span class="corr" id="xd25e32690"
title="Not in source">,</span> parrots and pigeons, who also received
the same dole as their owners. So evenly just was
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n in the matter of his allowances, that the
prettiest of his favourites received the same allowance as the roughest
carabineer.<a class="noteref" id="n363.1src" href="#n363.1" name="n363.1src">46</a></p>
<p>The Lord of the City of Pleasure was deeply religious. Whenever he
was amusing himself two of his companions held in front of him a cloth
to remind him of his shroud. A thousand <i>H√°fizahs</i>, that is
women who knew the Kur&acirc;√°n by heart, constantly repeated
its holy verses, and, under the orders of the king, whenever he changed
his raiment the <i>H√°fizahs</i> blew on his body from head to
foot with their prayer-hallowed breath.<a class="noteref" id="n363.2src" href="#n363.2" name="n363.2src">47</a> None of the five
daily prayers passed unprayed. If at any of the hours of prayer the
king was asleep he was sprinkled with water, and when water failed to
arouse him, he was dragged out of bed. Even when dragged out of bed by
his servants the king never <span class="corr" id="xd25e32713" title="Source: uttured">uttered</span> an improper or querulous word.</p>
<p>So keen was his sense of justice that when one of his courtiers
pretending he had purchased her, brought to him a maiden of ideal
beauty, and her relations, not knowing she had been given to the king,
came to complain, though they gladly resigned her, the king grieved

palace.<a class="noteref" id="n363.3src" href="#n363.3" name="n363.3src">48</a> So great was the king&rsquo;s charity that every
night below his pillow he placed a bag containing some thousand
gold-mohurs, and before evening all were distributed to the deserving.
So religious was the king that he paid 50,000 <i>tankas</i> for each of
the four feet of the ass of Christ. A man came bringing a fifth hoof,
and one of the courtiers said: &ldquo;My Lord, an ass has four feet. I

sober was the king that he would neither look upon nor hear of
intoxicants or stimulants. A potion that had cost 100,000 <i>tankas</i>
was brought to him. Among the 300 ingredients one was nutmeg. The king
directed the potion to be thrown into a drain. His favourite horse fell
sick. The king ordered it to have medicine, and the horse recovered.
&ldquo;What medicine was given the horse?&rdquo; asked the king.
&ldquo;The medicine ordered by the physicians&rdquo; replied his
servants. Fearing that in this medicine there might be an intoxicant,
the king commanded that the horse should be taken out of the stables
and turned loose into the forest.<a class="noteref" id="n364.1src"

<p>The king&rsquo;s spirit of peace steeped the land, which, like its
ruler, after thirty years of fighting yearned for rest. For fourteen
years neither inward malcontent nor foreign foe broke the quiet. In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1482 Bahlol Lodi advanced from Dehli
to subdue M√°lwa. The talk of M√°ndu was Bahlol&rsquo;s
approach, but no whisper of it passed into the charmed City of Women.
At last the son-minister forced his way into the king&rsquo;s presence.
At the news of pressing danger his soldier-spirit awoke in
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n. His orders for meeting the invaders were so
prompt and well-planned that the king of Dehli paid a ransom and
withdrew. A second rest of fifteen years ended in the son-minister once
more forcing his way into the Presence. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1500 the son presented his father, now an aged
man of eighty, with a cup of sherbet and told him to drink. The king,
whose armlet of bezoar stone had already twice made poison harmless,
drew the stone from his arm. He thanked the Almighty for granting him,
unworthy, the happiest life that had ever fallen to the lot of man. He
prayed that the sin of his death might not be laid to his son&rsquo;s
charge, drank the poison, and died.<a class="noteref" id="n364.2src"

<p>Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n can hardly have shut himself off so
completely from state affairs as the story-tellers make out. He seems
to have been the first of the M√°lwa kings who minted gold. He
also introduced new titles and ornaments, which implies an interest in

his <i>har&iacute;m</i>, sit on the throne and receive the salutations
of his nobles and subjects, and give orders in all weighty matters of
state. He used to entrust all minor affairs to his ministers; but in

not act hastily. He wrote to Mehm&uacute;d asking him to come to his

satisfied that Mehm&uacute;d did not wish for a peaceful settlement he
advanced on M√°ndu. Meanwhile Mehm&uacute;d had repaired the
walls of M√°ndu, which soon after was invested by Bah√°dur.
The siege was proceeding in regular course by mines and batteries, and
the garrison, though overtaxed, were still loyal and in heart, when in

extremely high. With a few followers the Sult√°n scaled Songad,

when B√°z Bah√°dur went out to meet Akbar&rsquo;s general,
Adham Kh√°n Atkah, he placed R&uacute;p Mati and his other
singers in S√°rangp&uacute;r under a party of his men with orders
to kill the women in case of a reverse. On hearing of B√°z
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s defeat the soldiers hastily sabred as many of
the women as they could and fled. Among the women left for dead was
R&uacute;p Mati, who, though dangerously wounded, was not killed. When
Adham Atkah entered S√°rangp&uacute;r his first care was to
enquire what had become of R&uacute;p Mati. On hearing of her condition
he had her wound attended to by the best surgeons, promising her, as a
help to her cure, a speedy union with her beloved. On her recovery
R&uacute;p Mati claimed the general&rsquo;s promise. He prevaricated

Mati to gain time invited him to her own pavilion which she said was
specially adorned to be the abode of love. Next night the Atkah went to
her house in disguise. Her women directed him to R&uacute;p
Mati&rsquo;s couch. Adham found her robed and garlanded, but cold in
death. R&uacute;p Mati was buried on an island in a lake at Ujjain, and

Akbar&rsquo;s historian, the great Abul Fazl, described M√°ndu as
a large city whose fortress is twenty-four miles (twelve <i>kos</i>) in
circuit. He notices that besides in the centre of the hill where stands
an eight-storeyed minaret, the city had many monuments of ancient
magnificence, among them the tombs of the Khilji Sult√°ns. And
that from the dome which is over the sepulchre of Sult√°n
Mehm&uacute;d, the son of Hoshang (this should be the sepulchre of
Hoshang built by his successor Sult√°n Mehm&uacute;d) water drops
in the height of summer to the astonishment of the ignorant. But, he
adds, men of understanding know how to account for the
water-drops.<a class="noteref" id="n371.5src" href="#n371.5" name="n371.5src">101</a> Abul Fazl further notices that on M√°ndu Hill
is found a species of tamarind whose fruit is as big as the cocoanut,

The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">History</span></i><br>
The Mughals, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1570&ndash;1720.</span>
which is very white. This is the African baobab or <span lang="la">Adansonia digitata</span>, known in Hindust√°ni as
<i>goramli</i> or white tamarind, whose great fruit is about the size
of a cocoanut. Its monster baobabs are still a feature of M√°ndu.
Some among them look old enough to have been yielding fruit 300 years
ago. Finally Abul Fazl refers to M√°ndu as one of twenty-eight
towns where Akbar&rsquo;s copper coins were struck.<a class="noteref"
id="n372.1src" href="#n372.1" name="n372.1src">102</a> About twenty
years later (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1610) the historian
Farishtah<a class="noteref" id="n372.2src" href="#n372.2" name="n372.2src">103</a> thus describes the hill. The fort of M√°ndu
is a work of solid masonry deemed to be one of the strongest
fortifications in that part of the world. It is built on an insulated
mountain thirty-eight miles in circumference.<a class="noteref" id="n372.3src" href="#n372.3" name="n372.3src">104</a> The place of a
ditch round the fortification is supplied by a natural ravine so deep
that it seems impossible to take the fort by regular approaches. Within
the fort is abundance of water and forage, but the area is not large
enough to grow a sufficient store of grain. The hill cannot be
invested. The easiest access is from the north by the Dehli Gate. The
south road with an entrance by the T√°r√°p&uacute;r Gate is
so steep that cavalry can with difficulty be led up. Like Abul Fazl
Farishtah notices that, except during the rains, water constantly oozes
from between the chinks in the masonry of the dome of Sult√°n
Hoshang&rsquo;s tomb. He says the natives of India attribute this
dropping to universal veneration for Sult√°n Hoshang, for whose
death, they say, the very stones shed tears.</p>
<p>Except that copper coins continued to be minted and that it was
nominally one of the four capitals of the empire, during the emperor
Akbar&rsquo;s reign M√°ndu was practically deserted. The only
traces of Akbar&rsquo;s presence on the hill are in two of the five
inscriptions already quoted from the N&iacute;lkanth pleasure-house,
dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1591 and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1600.</p>
<p>After about fifty years of almost complete neglect the emperor
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r, during a few months in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1617, enabled M√°ndu once more to justify
its title of Sh√°di√°b√°d, the Abode of Joy. Early in
March <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1617, in the eleventh year of
his reign, the emperor Jeh√°ng&iacute;r after spending four
months in travelling the 189 miles from Ajm&iacute;r by way of Ujjain,
arrived at <span class="corr" id="xd25e33576" title="Source: N&acirc;alchah">Na&acirc;lchah</span> on the main land close
to the north of M√°ndu. The emperor notices that most of the
forty-six marches into which the 189 miles were divided ended on the
bank of some lake stream or great river in green grass and woody
landscape, brightened by poppy fields. We came, he writes, enjoying the
beauty of the country and shooting, never weary, as if we were moving
from one garden to another.</p>
<p>Of the country round Na&acirc;lchah Jeh√°ng&iacute;r
says:<a class="noteref" id="n372.4src" href="#n372.4" name="n372.4src">105</a> What can be written worthy of the beauty and the
pleasantness of Na&acirc;lchah. The neighbourhood is full of mango
trees. The whole country is one unbroken and restful evergreen. Owing
to its beauty I remained there three days. I granted the place to
Kam√°l Kh√°n, taking it from Keshava M√°r&uacute;,
and I changed its name to Kam√°lp&uacute;r. I had frequent
meetings with some of the wise men of the <i>jogis</i>, many of whom
had assembled here. Na&acirc;lchah is one of the best places in
M√°lwa. It has an extensive growth of vines, and among its mango
groves and vineyards wander streamlets of water. I arrived at a time
when, contrary to the northern climes, the vines were in blossom and
fruit, and so great was the vintage that the meanest boor could eat
grapes to his fill. The poppy was also in flower, and its fields
delighted the eye with their many-coloured beauty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span></p>

<i><span class="sc">History</span></i><br>
The Mughals, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1570&ndash;1720.</span>
Of the emperor&rsquo;s entrance into M√°ndu the Memoirs have the
following note: On Monday the 23rd of Ispand√°d, the last month
of the Persian year, that is according to Sir Thomas Roe&rsquo;s
account on the 6th of March 1617, when one quarter of the day had
passed, I mounted my elephant, and, in good fortune and under kindly
influences, made my happy entry into the fort of M√°ndu. About an
hour (three <i>ghadis</i>) later I entered the quarters which had been
prepared to receive me. During my passage across the hill-top I
scattered <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1500. Before my arrival Abdul
Kar&iacute;m the engineer had been sent by me to repair the buildings
of the former kings of M√°ndu. While my fortunate standards were
at Ajm&iacute;r Abdul Kar&iacute;m repaired such of the old
M√°ndu buildings as were fit to be repaired and built others
anew. On the whole he had provided quarters for me, the like of which
have probably never been built in any other place. Three
<i>l√°khs</i> of rupees were spent on these repairs and
buildings. I wish it had been possible to construct buildings like
these in all cities likely to be visited by royalty. This fortress, he
continues, stands on the top of a hill about thirty-six miles (18
<i>kos</i>) in circumference. They say that before the days of
R√°ja Bikram√°jit a king was reigning over these parts
<span class="corr" id="xd25e33625" title="Source: who">whose</span>
name was Jaisingh Deva. In his time a man went to the forest to cut
grass. When he brought the grass back he found that the blade of his
sickle had turned yellow. The grasscutter in his surprise went to
M√°ndan, an ironsmith. M√°ndan knew that the sickle was
gold. He had heard that in those parts was to be found the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone, whose touch turns iron and copper into gold.
He told the grasscutter to lead him to the place where the sickle had
turned yellow, and there he found the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. The
smith presented this treasure to his king. The king amassed untold
wealth, part of which he spent in building M√°ndu fortress which
he completed in twelve years. At the request of the smith on most of
the stones in the walls a mark was cut in the form of an anvil. Towards
the close of his life, when king Jaisingh Deva withdrew his heart from
the world, he called many Br√°hmans together on the bank of the
Narbada close to M√°ndu. He gave each Br√°hman a share of
his wealth. And to the Br√°hman in whom he had the greatest faith
he gave the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. Enraged at the gift of a paltry
stone the Br√°hman threw it into the Narbada, and there the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone still lies. The emperor continues: On the
20th of <i>Farward&iacute;n</i>, five weeks after my arrival (11th
April 1617) in reward for his services in repairing the buildings of
M√°ndu, I conferred on my engineer Abdul Kar&iacute;m the command
of 1200 horse, with the title of Ma√°m&uacute;r Kh√°n.</p>
<p>M√°ndu had for the emperor the strong attraction of abundance
of game. Among numerous entries of <i>n&iacute;lg√°i</i> or
blue-bull shooting the following occur: On the 4th of the first month
of <i>Farward&iacute;n</i> (16th) March the watchmen of the chase
brought word that they had marked down a lion near the S√°gar
Lake, which is a construction of the ancient rulers of M√°ndu. I
mounted and proceeded towards the lake. When the lion broke cover he
attacked and wounded ten or twelve of the
<i>Ah√°d&iacute;s</i><a class="noteref" id="n373.1src" href="#n373.1" name="n373.1src">106</a> and other men of my retinue. In the
end I brought him down with three gun shots and saved God&rsquo;s
creatures from his evil. On the 22nd of the same month (April 3rd,
1617) the watchmen brought news of a tiger. I mounted forthwith and
despatched him with three bullets. On the 7th of <i>Ard&iacute;
Bihisht</i> (April 18th, 1617) the watchmen brought word that they had
marked down four tigers. At one in the afternoon I started for the

place with N&uacute;r Jeh√°n Begam. N&uacute;r Jeh√°n asked
my leave to shoot the tigers with her gun. I said &ldquo;Be it
so.&rdquo; In a trice she killed these four tigers with six bullets. I
had never seen such shooting. To shoot from the back of an elephant
from within a closed <i>howdah</i> and bring down with six bullets four
wild beasts without giving them an opportunity of moving or springing
is wonderful. In acknowledgment of this capital marksmanship I ordered
a thousand <i>ashrafis</i> (<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 4500) to be
scattered<a class="noteref" id="n374.1src" href="#n374.1" name="n374.1src">107</a> over N&uacute;r Jeh√°n and granted her a pair
of ruby wristlets worth a l√°kh of rupees.<a class="noteref" id="n374.2src" href="#n374.2" name="n374.2src">108</a></p>
<p>Of the mangoes of M√°ndu Jeh√°ng&iacute;r says: In these
days many mangoes have come into my fruit stores from the Dakhan,
Burh√°npur, Gujar√°t, and the districts of M√°lwa.
This country is famous for its mangoes. There are few places the
mangoes of which can rival those of this country in richness of
flavour, in sweetness, in freedom from fibre, and in size.<a class="noteref" id="n374.3src" href="#n374.3" name="n374.3src">109</a></p>
<p>The rains set in with unusual severity. Rain fell for forty days
continuously. With the rain were severe thunderstorms accompanied by
lightning which injured some of the old buildings.<a class="noteref"
id="n374.4src" href="#n374.4" name="n374.4src">110</a> His account of
the beauty of the hill in July, when clear sunshine followed the forty
days of rain, is one of the pleasantest passages in
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s Memoirs: What words of mine can describe
the beauty of the grass and of the wild flowers! They clothe each hill
and dale, each slope and plain. I know of no place so pleasant in
climate and so pretty in scenery as M√°ndu in the rainy season.
This month of July which is one of the months of the hot season, the
sun being in Leo, one cannot sleep within the house without a coverlet,
and during the day there is no need for a fan. What I have noticed is
but a small part of the many beauties of M√°ndu. Two things I
have seen here which I had seen nowhere in India. One of them is the
tree of the wild plantain which grows all over the hill top, the other
is the nest of the <i>mamolah</i> or wagtail. Till now no bird-catcher
could tell its nest. It so happened that in the building where I lodged
we found a wagtail&rsquo;s nest with two young ones.</p>
<p>The following additional entries in the Memoirs belong to
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s stay at M√°ndu. Among the presents
submitted by Mah√°bat Kh√°n, who received the honour of
kissing the ground at M√°ndu, Jeh√°ng&iacute;r describes a
ruby weighing eleven <i>misk√°ls</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n374.5src" href="#n374.5" name="n374.5src">111</a> He says: This ruby
was brought to Ajm&iacute;r last year by a Frankish jeweller who wanted

respects and present their tribute. The Hindu chief of

evil fortune, did not come to kiss the threshold.<a class="noteref" id="n375.1src" href="#n375.1" name="n375.1src">113</a> For this reason I
ordered Fid√°&iacute;kh√°n to pillage the

or five hundred matchlockmen. On the approach of
Fid√°&iacute;kh√°n the chief fled. He is now reported to
regret his past conduct and to intend to come to Court and make his
submission. On the 9th of <i>Y&uacute;r</i>, the sixth month of the
Persian calendar (late July, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1617), I
heard that while raiding the lands of the chief of
J&iacute;tp&uacute;r, R&uacute;h-ul-l√°h, the brother of
Fid√°&iacute;kh√°n, was slain with a lance in the village
where the chief&rsquo;s wives and children were in hiding. The village
was burned, and the women and daughters of the rebel chief were taken

<p>The beautiful surroundings of the S√°gar lake offered to the
elegant taste of N&uacute;r Jeh√°n a fitting opportunity for
honouring the Shab-i-Bar√°t or Night of Jubilee with special
illuminations. The emperor describes the result in these words: On the
evening of Thursday the 19th of <i>Amard√°d</i>, the fifth month
of the Persian year (early July, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1617), I went with the ladies of the palace to
see the buildings and palaces on the S√°gar lake which were built
by the old kings of M√°ndu. The 26th of <i>Amard√°d</i>
(about mid-July) was the Shab-i-Bar√°t holiday. I ordered a
jubilee or assembly of joy to be held on the occasion in one of the
palaces occupied by N&uacute;r Jeh√°n Begam in the midst of the
big lake. The nobles and others were invited to attend this party which
was organized by the Begam, and I ordered the cup and other intoxicants
with various fruits and minced meats to be given to all who wished
them. It was a wonderful gathering. As evening set in the lanterns and
lamps gleaming along the banks of the lake made an illumination such as
never had been seen. The countless lights with which the palaces and

<p>The Memoirs continue: On Sunday the 9th of <i>Y&uacute;r</i>, the
sixth Persian month (late July), I went with the ladies of the palace
to the quarters of &Aacute;saf Kh√°n, N&uacute;r
Jeh√°n&rsquo;s brother, the second son of Mirza Ghi√°s Beg.
I found &Aacute;saf Kh√°n lodged in a glen of great beauty
surrounded by other little vales and dells with waterfalls and running
streamlets and green and shady mango groves. In one of these dells were
from two to three hundred sweet pandanus or <i>kewda</i> trees. I
passed a very happy day in this spot and got up a wine party with some
of my lords-in-waiting, giving them bumpers of wine.<a class="noteref"

(early September) Jeh√°ng&iacute;r has the following
entry<a class="noteref" id="n375.5src" href="#n375.5" name="n375.5src">117</a> regarding a visit from his eldest son and heir
prince Khurram, afterwards the emperor Shah Jeh√°n, who had
lately brought the war in the Dakhan to a successful close. On the 8th
of the month of <i>M√°h</i> (H. 1026: according to Roe September
2nd, 1617), my son of exalted name obtained the good fortune of waiting
upon me in the fort of M√°ndu after three-quarters and one
<i>ghadi</i> of the day had passed, that is about half an hour after
sunrise. He had been absent fifteen months and eleven days. After he
had performed the ceremonies of kissing the ground and the
<i>kurnish</i> or prostration, I called him up to my bay window or
<i>jharokah</i>. In a transport of affection I could not restrain
myself from getting up and taking him into my arms. The more

I increased the measure of affection and honours the more humility and
respect did he show. I called him near me and made him sit by me. He
submitted a thousand <i>ashrafis</i> (= <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>
4500) and a thousand rupees as a gift or <i>nazar</i> and the same
amount as sacrifice or <i>nis√°r</i>. As there was not time for
me to inspect all his presents he produced the elephant Sarn√°k,
the best of the elephants of &Aacute;dil Kh√°n of Bij√°pur.
He also gave me a case full of the rarest precious stones. I ordered
the military paymasters to make presents to his nobles according to
their rank. The first to come was Kh√°n Jeh√°n, whom I
allowed the honour of kissing my feet. For his victory over the
R√°na of Chitor I had before granted to my fortunate child Kurram
the rank of a commander of 20,000 with 10,000 horse. Now for his
service in the Dakhan I made him a commander of 30,000 and 20,000 horse
with the title of Sh√°h Jeh√°n. I also ordered that
henceforward he should enjoy the privilege of sitting on a stool near
my throne, an honour which did not exist and is the first of its kind
granted to anyone in my family. I further granted him a special dress.
To do him honour I came down from the window and with my own hand
scattered over his head as sacrifice a trayfull of precious stones as
well as a large trayfull of gold.</p>
<p>Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s last M√°ndu entry is this: On
the night of Friday in the month of <i>Ab√°n</i> (October 24th,
1617) in all happiness and good fortune I marched from M√°ndu and
halted on the bank of the lake at Na&acirc;lchah.</p>
<p>Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s stay at M√°ndu is referred to
by more than one English traveller. In March 1617, the Rev. Edward
Terry, chaplain to the Right Honourable Sir T. Roe Lord Ambassador to
the Great Mughal, came to M√°ndu from <span class="corr" id="xd25e33883" title="Source: Burh√°np&uacute;r">Burh√°npur</span> in east
Kh√°ndesh.<a class="noteref" id="n376.1src" href="#n376.1" name="n376.1src">118</a> Terry crossed a broad river, the Narbada, at a
great town called Anchabarpur (Akbarpur)<a class="noteref" id="n376.2src" href="#n376.2" name="n376.2src">119</a> in the
N&iacute;m√°r plain not far south of M√°ndu hill. The way
up, probably by the Bhairav pass a few miles east of M√°ndu,
seemed to Terry exceeding long. The ascent was very difficult, taking
the carriages, apparently meaning coaches and wagons, two whole
days.<a class="noteref" id="n376.3src" href="#n376.3" name="n376.3src">120</a> Terry found the hill of M√°ndu stuck round
with fair trees that kept their distance so, one from and below the
other, that there was much delight in beholding them from either the
bottom or the top of the hill. From one side only was the ascent not
very high and steep. The top was flat plain and spacious with vast and

Appendix II.<br>
The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">History</span></i><br>
The Mughals, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1570&ndash;1720.</span>
far-stretching woods in which were lions tigers and other beasts of
prey and many wild elephants. Terry passed through M√°ndu a few
days&rsquo; march across a plain and level country, apparently towards
Dh√°r, where he met the Lord Ambassador Sir Thomas Roe, who had
summoned Terry from Surat to be his chaplain. Sir Thomas Roe was then
marching from Ajm&iacute;r to M√°ndu with the Court of the
emperor Jeh√°ng&iacute;r, whom Terry calls the Great King.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of March, says Roe, the Mughal was to have entered
M√°ndu. But all had to wait for the good hour fixed by the
astrologers. From the 6th of March, when he entered M√°ndu, till
the 24th of October, the emperor Jeh√°ng&iacute;r, with Sir
Thomas Roe in attendance, remained at M√°ndu.<a class="noteref"
id="n377.1src" href="#n377.1" name="n377.1src">121</a> According to Roe
before the Mughal visited M√°ndu the hill was not much inhabited,
having more ruins by far than standing houses.<a class="noteref" id="n377.2src" href="#n377.2" name="n377.2src">122</a> But the moving city
that accompanied the emperor soon overflowed the hill-top. According to
Roe Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s own encampment was walled round half
a mile in circuit in the form of a fortress, with high screens or
curtains of coarse stuff, somewhat like Aras hangings, red on the
outside, the inside divided into compartments with a variety of
figures. This enclosure had a handsome gateway and the circuit was
formed into various coins and bulwarks. The posts that supported the
curtains were all surmounted with brass tops.<a class="noteref" id="n377.3src" href="#n377.3" name="n377.3src">123</a> Besides the
emperor&rsquo;s encampment were the noblemen&rsquo;s quarters, each at
an appointed distance from the king&rsquo;s tents, very handsome, some
having their tents green, others white, others of mixed colours. The
whole composed the most curious and magnificent sight Roe had ever
beheld.<a class="noteref" id="n377.4src" href="#n377.4" name="n377.4src">124</a> The hour taken by Jeh√°ng&iacute;r in passing
from the Dehli Gate to his own quarters, the two English miles from
Roe&rsquo;s lodge which was not far from the Dehli Gate to
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s palace, and other reasons noted below
make it almost certain that the Mughal&rsquo;s encampment and the camps
of the leading nobles were on the open slopes to the south of the Sea
Lake between B√°z Bah√°dur&rsquo;s palace on the east and
Songad on the west. And that the palace at M√°ndu from which
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r wrote was the building now known as B√°z
Bah√°dur&rsquo;s palace.<a class="noteref" id="n377.5src" href="#n377.5" name="n377.5src">125</a> A few months before it reached
M√°ndu the imperial camp had turned the whole valley of
Ajm&iacute;r into a magnificent city,<a class="noteref" id="n377.6src"
href="#n377.6" name="n377.6src">126</a> and a few weeks before reaching
M√°ndu at Thoda, about fifty miles south-east of Ajm&iacute;r,
the camp formed a settlement not less in circuit than twenty English
miles, equalling in size almost any town in Europe.<a class="noteref"
id="n377.7src" href="#n377.7" name="n377.7src">127</a> In the middle of
the encampment were all sorts of shops so regularly disposed that all
persons knew where to go for everything.</p>
<p>The demands of so great a city overtaxed the powers of the deserted
M√°ndu. The scarcity of water soon became so pressing that the
poor were commanded to leave and all horses and cattle were ordered off
the hill.<a class="noteref" id="n377.8src" href="#n377.8" name="n377.8src">128</a> Of the scarcity of water the English traveller
Corryat, who was then a guest of Sir Thomas Roe, writes: On the first
day one of my Lord&rsquo;s people, Master Herbert, brother to Sir
Edward Herbert, found a fountain which, if he had not done, he would
have had to send ten course <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

The Hill Fort of M√°ndu.<br>
<i><span class="sc">History</span></i><br>
The Mughals, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1570&ndash;1720.</span>
(<i>kos</i>) every day for water to a river called Narbada that falleth
into the Bay of Cambye near Broach. The custom being such that
whatsoever fountain or tank is found by any great man in time of
drought he shall keep it proper to his without interruption. The day
after one of the king&rsquo;s Hadis (<i>Ah√°dis</i>) finding the
same and striving for it was taken by my Lord&rsquo;s people and
bound.<a class="noteref" id="n378.1src" href="#n378.1" name="n378.1src">129</a> Corryat adds: During the time of the great drought
two Moor nobles daily sent ten camels to the Narbada and distributed
the water to the poor, which was so dear they sold a little skin for 8
pies (one penny).<a class="noteref" id="n378.2src" href="#n378.2" name="n378.2src">130</a></p>
<p>Terry notices that among the piles of buildings that held their
heads above ruin were not a few unfrequented mosques or Muhammadan
churches. Though the people who attended the king were marvellously
straitened for room to put their most excellent horses, none would use
the churches as stables, even though they were forsaken and out of use.
This abstinence seems to have been voluntary, as Roe&rsquo;s servants,
who were sent in advance, took possession of a fair court with walled
enclosure in which was a goodly temple and a tomb. It was the best in
the whole circuit of M√°ndu, the only drawback being that it was
two miles from the king&rsquo;s house.<a class="noteref" id="n378.3src"
href="#n378.3" name="n378.3src">131</a> The air was wholesome and the
prospect was pleasant, as it was on the edge of the hill.<a class="noteref" id="n378.4src" href="#n378.4" name="n378.4src">132</a> The
emperor, perhaps referring rather to the south of the hill, which from
the elaborate building and repairs carried out in advance by Abdul
Kar&iacute;m seems to have been called the New City, gives a less
deserted impression of M√°ndu. He writes (24th March 1617): Many
buildings and relics of the old kings are still standing, for as yet
decay has not fallen upon the city. On the 24th I rode to see the royal
edifices. First I visited the J√°m√° Masjid built by
Sult√°n Hoshang Ghori. It is a very lofty building and erected
entirely of hewn stone. Although it has been standing 180 years it
looks as if built to-day. Then I visited the sepulchres of the kings
and rulers of the Khilji dynasty, among which is the sepulchre of the
eternally cursed N√°sir-ud-d&iacute;n.<a class="noteref" id="n378.5src" href="#n378.5" name="n378.5src">133</a> Sher Sh√°h to
show his horror of N√°sir-ud-d&iacute;n, the father-slayer,
ordered his people to beat N√°sir-ud-d&iacute;n&rsquo;s tomb with
sticks. Jeh√°ngir also kicked the grave. Then he ordered the tomb
to be opened and the remains to be taken out and burnt. Finally,
fearing the remains might pollute the eternal light, he ordered the
ashes to be thrown into the Narbada.<a class="noteref" id="n378.6src"
href="#n378.6" name="n378.6src">134</a></p>
<p>The pleasant outlying position of Roe&rsquo;s lodge proved to be
open to the objection that out of the vast wilderness wild beasts often
came, seldom returning without a sheep, a goat, or a kid. One evening a
great lion leapt over the stone wall that encompassed the yard and
<span class="corr" id="xd25e34021" title="Source: snapt">snapped</span>
up the Lord Ambassador&rsquo;s little white neat shock, that is as Roe
explains a small Irish mastiff, which ran out barking at the lion. Out
of the ruins of the mosque and tomb Roe built a lodge,<a class="noteref" id="n378.7src" href="#n378.7" name="n378.7src">135</a> and
here he passed the rains with his &ldquo;family,&rdquo; including
besides his secretary, chaplain, and cook twenty-three Englishmen and
about sixty native servants, and during part of the time the sturdy
half-crazed traveller Tom Coryate or Corryat.<a class="noteref" id="n378.8src" href="#n378.8" name="n378.8src">136</a> They had

tables<a class="noteref" id="n379.2src" href="#n379.2" name="n379.2src">138</a> and chairs, since the Ambassador refused to adopt
the Mughal practice of sitting cross-legged on mats &ldquo;like taylors
on their shopboards.&rdquo; Roe&rsquo;s diet was dressed by an English
and an Indian cook and was served on plate by waiters in red taffata
cloaks guarded with green taffata. The chaplain wore a long black
cassock, and the Lord Ambassador wore English habits made as light and
cool as possible.<a class="noteref" id="n379.3src" href="#n379.3" name="n379.3src">139</a></p>
<p>On the 12th of March, a few days after they were settled at
M√°ndu, came the festival of the Persian New Year.
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r held a great reception seated on a throne of
gold bespangled with rubies emeralds and turquoises. The hall was
adorned with pictures of the King and Queen of England, the Princess
Elizabeth, Sir Thomas Smith and others, with beautiful Persian
hangings. On one side, on a little stage, was a couple of women
singers. The king commanded that Sir T. Roe should come up and stand
beside him on the steps of the throne where stood on one side the
Persian Ambassador and on the other the old king of Kandah√°r
with whom Sir T. Roe ranked. The king called the Persian Ambassador and
gave him some stones and a young elephant. The Ambassador knelt and
knocked his head against the steps of the throne to thank him.<a class="noteref" id="n379.4src" href="#n379.4" name="n379.4src">140</a> From
time to time during Terry&rsquo;s stay at M√°ndu, the Mughal,
with his stout daring Persian and Tartarian horsemen and some grandees,
went out to take young wild elephants in the great woods that environed
M√°ndu. The elephants were caught in strong toils prepared for
the purpose and were manned and made fit for service. In these hunts
the king and his men also pursued lions and other wild beasts on
horseback, killing some of them with their bows carbines and
lances.<a class="noteref" id="n379.5src" href="#n379.5" name="n379.5src">141</a></p>
<p>The first of September was Jeh√°ng&iacute;r&rsquo;s birthday.
The king, says Corryat,<a class="noteref" id="n379.6src" href="#n379.6"
name="n379.6src">142</a> was forty-five years old, of middle height,
corpulent, of a seemly composition of body, and of an olive coloured
skin. Roe went to pay his respects and was conducted apparently to
B√°z Bah√°dur&rsquo;s Gardens to the east of the Rewa Pool.
This tangled orchard was then a beautiful garden with a great square
pond or tank set all round with trees and flowers and in the middle of
the garden a pavilion or pleasure-house under which hung the scales in
which the king was to be weighed.<a class="noteref" id="n379.7src"
href="#n379.7" name="n379.7src">143</a> The scales were of beaten gold
set with many small stones as rubies and turquoises. They were hung by
chains of gold, large and massive, but strengthened by silken ropes.
The beam and tressels from which the scales hung were covered with thin
plates of gold. All round were the nobles of the court seated on rich
carpets waiting for the king. He came laden with diamonds rubies pearls
and other precious vanities, making a great and glorious show. His
swords targets and throne were corresponding in riches and splendour.
His head neck breast and arms above the elbows and at the wrist were
decked with chains of precious stones, and every finger had two or
three rich rings. His legs were as it were fettered with chains of
diamonds and rubies as large as walnuts and amazing pearls. He got into
the scales crouching or sitting on his legs like a woman. To
counterpoise his weight bags said to contain <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 9000 in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

silver were changed six times. After this he was weighed against bags
containing gold jewels and precious stones. Then against cloth of gold,
silk stuffs, cotton goods, spices, and all commodities. Last of all
against meal, butter, and corn. Except the silver, which was reserved
for the poor, all was said to be distributed to Baniahs (that is
Br√°hmans).<a class="noteref" id="n380.1src" href="#n380.1" name="n380.1src">144</a> After he was weighed Jeh√°ng&iacute;r
ascended the throne and had basons of nuts almonds and spices of all
sorts given him. These the king threw about, and his great men
scrambled prostrate on their bellies. Roe thought it not decent that he
should scramble. And the king seeing that he stood aloof reached him a
bason almost full and poured the contents into his cloak.<a class="noteref" id="n380.2src" href="#n380.2" name="n380.2src">145</a> Terry
adds: The physicians noted the king&rsquo;s weight and spoke
flatteringly of it. Then the Mughal drank to his nobles in his royal
wine and the nobles pledged his health, The king drank also to the Lord
Ambassador, whom he always treated with special consideration, and
presented him with the cup of gold curiously enamelled and crusted with
rubies turkesses and emeralds.<a class="noteref" id="n380.3src" href="#n380.3" name="n380.3src">146</a></p>
<p>Of prince Khurram&rsquo;s visit Roe writes: A month later (October
2nd) the proud prince Khurram, afterwards the emperor Sh√°h
Jeh√°n (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1626&ndash;1657),
returned from his glorious success in the Dakhan, accompanied by all
the great men, in wondrous triumph.<a class="noteref" id="n380.4src"
href="#n380.4" name="n380.4src">147</a> A week later (October 9th),
hearing that the emperor was to pass near his lodging on his way to
take the air at the Narbada, in accordance with the rule that the
masters of all houses near which the king passes must make him a
present, Roe took horse to meet the king. He offered the king an Atlas
neatly bound, saying he presented the king with the whole world. The
king was pleased. In return he praised Roe&rsquo;s lodge, which he had
built out of the ruins of the temple and the ancient tomb, and which
was one of the best lodges in the camp.<a class="noteref" id="n380.5src" href="#n380.5" name="n380.5src">148</a>
Jeh√°ng&iacute;r left M√°ndu on the 24th October. On the
30th when Roe started the hill was entirely deserted.<a class="noteref"
id="n380.6src" href="#n380.6" name="n380.6src">149</a></p>
<p>Terry mentions only two buildings at M√°ndu. One was the house
of the Mughal, apparently B√°z Bah√°dur&rsquo;s palace,
which he describes as large and stately, built of excellent stone, well
squared and put together, taking up a large compass of ground. He adds:
We could never see how it was contrived within, as the king&rsquo;s
wives and women were there.<a class="noteref" id="n380.7src" href="#n380.7" name="n380.7src">150</a> The only other building to which
Terry refers, he calls &ldquo;The Grot.&rdquo; Of the grot, which is
almost certainly the pleasure-house N&iacute;lkanth, whose Persian
inscriptions have been quoted above, Terry gives the following details:
To the Mughal&rsquo;s house, at a small distance from it, belonged a
very curious grot. In the building of the grot a way was made into a

firm rock which showed itself on the side of the hill canopied over
with part of that rock. It was a place that had much beauty in it by
reason of the curious workmanship bestowed on it and much pleasure by
reason of its coolness.<a class="noteref" id="n381.1src" href="#n381.1"

of the charmingly cool and murmuring scallopped rillstones where, as
Terry says, water runs down a broad stone table with many hollows like
to scallop shells, in its passage over the hollows making so pretty a
murmur as helps to tie the senses with the bonds of sleep.</p>
<p>Sh√°h Jeh√°n seems to have been pleased with
M√°ndu. He returned in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1621 and

Jeh√°n Lodi&rsquo;s siege of M√°ndu is interesting in
connection with a description of M√°ndu in Herbert&rsquo;s
Travels. Herbert, who was in Gujar√°t in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1626, says M√°ndu is seated at the side of
a declining hill (apparently Herbert refers to the slope from the
southern crest northwards to S√°gar Lake and the Grot or
N&iacute;lkanth) in which both for ornament and defence is a castle
which is strong in being encompassed with a defensive wall of nearly
five miles (probably <i>kos</i> that is ten miles): the whole, he adds,
heretofore had fifteen miles circuit. But the city later built is of
less time yet fresher beauty, whether you behold the temples (in one of
which are entombed four kings), palaces or fortresses, especially that
tower which is elevated 170 steps, supported by massive pillars and
adorned with gates and windows very observable. It was built by
Kh√°n Jeh√°n, who there lies buried. The confusedness of
these details shows that Herbert obtained them second-hand, probably
from Corryat&rsquo;s Master Herbert on Sir T. Roe&rsquo;s

India so abounds with tigers as the neighbourhood of the once famous
city of M√°ndu. The capital now deserted by man is overgrown by
forest and from being the seat of luxury, elegance, and wealth, it has
become the abode of wild beasts and is resorted to by the few Europeans
in that quarter for the pleasure of destroying them. Instances have
been known of tigers being so bold as to carry off troopers riding in
the ranks of their regiments. Twelve years later (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1839) Mr. Fergusson<a class="noteref" id="n383.7src" href="#n383.7" name="n383.7src">168</a> found the hill a
vast uninhabited jungle, the rank vegetation tearing the buildings of
the city to pieces and obscuring them so that they could hardly be
seen.<a class="noteref" id="n383.8src" href="#n383.8" name="n383.8src">169</a> Between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1842 and
1852 tigers are described as prowling among the regal rooms, the
half-savage marauding Bh&iacute;l as eating his meal and feeding his
cattle in the cloisters of its sanctuaries and the insidious
<i>p&iacute;pal</i> as levelling to the earth the magnificent
remains.<a class="noteref" id="n383.9src" href="#n383.9" name="n383.9src">170</a> So favourite a tiger retreat was the Jah√°z
Palace that it was dangerous to venture into it unarmed. Close to the
very huts of the poor central village, near the J√°m√°
Mosque, cattle were frequently seized by tigers. In the south tigers
came nightly to drink at the S√°gar lake. Huge bonfires had to be
burnt to prevent them attacking the houses.<a class="noteref" id="n383.10src" href="#n383.10" name="n383.10src">171</a> In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1883 Captain Eastwick wrote: At M√°ndu the

drive across the northern ravine-moat through the three gateways and
along the hill-top, at least as far south as the Sea Lake. Large
stretches of the level are cleared and tilled, and herds of cattle
graze free from the dread of wild beasts. The leading buildings have

rare as the wild elephant, and finally its old wholesomeness has
returned to the air of the hill-top.</p>
<p>This sketch notices only the main events and the main buildings.
Even about the main buildings much is still doubtful. Many
inscriptions, some in the puzzling interlaced <i>Tughra</i> character,
have still to be read. They may bring to light traces of the
M√°ndu kings and of the Mughal emperors, whose connection with
M√°ndu, so far as the buildings are concerned, is still a blank.
The ruins are so many and so widespread that weeks are wanted to ensure
their complete examination. It may be hoped that at no distant date
Major Delasseau, the Political Agent of Dh√°r, whose
opportunities are not more special than his knowledge, may be able to
prepare a complete description of the hill and of its many ruins and

were specially carved for use in a Muslim building. The porch on the
north side of the tomb enclosure is described (Ditto, page 543) as
composed of pillars avowedly re-erected from a Jain building. This note
of Mr. Fergusson&rsquo;s must have gone astray, as the north porch of

&Acirc;m&iacute;d Sh√°h Ghori) attributes to him the construction
of the fort of Dh√°r. He says (Memoirs <abbr title="Persian">Pers.</abbr> Text, 201&ndash;202): Dh√°r is one of the
oldest cities of India. R√°ja Bhoj, one of the famous ancient
Hindu kings, lived in this city. From his time up to this a thousand
years have passed. Dh√°r was also the capital of the Muhammadan
rulers of M√°lwa. When Sult√°n Muhammad Tughlak
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1325) was on his way to the conquest
of the Dakhan he built a cut-stone fort on a raised site. Its outline
is very elegant and beautiful, but the space inside is empty of
buildings. &Acirc;m&iacute;d Sh√°h Ghori, known as Dil√°war
Kh√°n, who in the days of Sult√°n Muhammad the son of
Sult√°n <span class="corr" id="xd25e32202" title="Source: Fir&uacute;z">F&iacute;r&uacute;z</span>, king of Dehli,
gained the independent rule of M√°lwa, built outside this fort an
assembly mosque, which has in front of it fixed in the ground a
four-cornered iron column about four feet round. When Sult√°n
Bah√°dur of Gujar√°t took M√°lwa (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1530&ndash;31) he wished to carry this column to
Gujar√°t. In digging it up the pillar fell and broke in two, one
piece measuring twenty-two feet the other thirteen feet. As it was
lying here uncared-for<span class="corr" id="xd25e32209" title="Not in source">,</span> I (Jeh√°ng&iacute;r) ordered the big
piece to be carried to &Aacute;gra to be put up in the courtyard of the
shrine of him whose abode is the heavenly throne (Akbar), to be
utilised as a lamp post. The mosque has two gates. In front of the arch
of one gate they have fixed a stone tablet engraved with a prose
passage to the effect that &Acirc;hm&iacute;d Sh√°h Ghori in the
year H. 808 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1405) laid the
foundation of this mosque. On the other arch they have written a poetic
inscription of which the following verses are a part:</p>

Farishtah says (<abbr title="Persian">Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 468): The
fort of M√°ndu is built on the top of a mountain, and the line of
its fortification is about twenty-eight miles in length. In place of a
moat it is surrounded by a deep chasm, so that it is impossible to use
missiles against it. Within the fort water and provisions are abundant
and it includes land enough to grow grain for the garrison. The extent
of its walls makes it impossible for an army to invest it. Most of the
villages near it are too small to furnish supplies to a besieging
force. The south or T√°r√°p&uacute;r gate is exceedingly
difficult of access. A horseman can hardly approach it. From whichever
side the fort may be attempted, most difficult heights have to be
scaled. The long distances and intervening hills prevent the watchers
of the besieging force communicating with each other. The gate on the
side of Delhi is of easier access than the other gates.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n359.4src">&uarr;</a></p>

detailed, but also more confused, story is told in the
W√°ki&#259;t-i-Musht√°ki (Elliot, IV. 552&ndash;54): A man
named Mehm&uacute;d, son of Mugh&iacute;s Khilji, came to Hoshang and
entered his service. He was a treacherous man, who secretly aspired to
the throne. He became minister, and gave his daughter in marriage to
the king. [Farishtah, <abbr title="Persian">Pers.</abbr>
Text<span class="corr" id="xd25e32416" title="Not in source">,</span>
II. 474, says: &ldquo;Malik Mugh&iacute;s gave his daughter
(Mehm&uacute;d&rsquo;s sister) in marriage, not to Hoshang, but to
Hoshang&rsquo;s son Muhammad Shah.&rdquo;] His father Malik
Mugh&iacute;s, coming to know of his son&rsquo;s ambitious designs,
informed the king of them. Hereupon Mehm&uacute;d feigned illness, and
to deceive the king&rsquo;s physicians shut himself in a dark room and
drank the blood of a newly killed goat. When the physicians came
Mehm&uacute;d rose hastily, threw up the blood into a basin, and
tossing back his head rolled on the floor as if in pain. The physicians
called for a light. When they saw that what Mehm&uacute;d had spat up
was blood they were satisfied of his sickness, and told the king that
Mehm&uacute;d had not long to live. The king refrained from killing a
dying man. This strange story seems to be an embellishment of a passage
in Farishtah (<abbr title="Persian">Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 477). When
Kh√°n Jeh√°n, that is Malik Mugh&iacute;s the father of
Mehm&uacute;d, was ordered by Sult√°n Muhammad to take the field
against the R√°jput rebels of N√°doti (H√°roti?) many
of the old nobles of M√°lwa went with him. In their absence the
party hostile to the Khiljis represented to Sult√°n Muhammad that
Mehm&uacute;d Khilji was plotting his death. On hearing that the
Sult√°n was enraged against him Mehm&uacute;d secluded himself
from the Court on pretence of illness. At the same time he worked
secretly and bribed Sult√°n Muhammad&rsquo;s cup-bearer to poison
his master. On the death of Sult√°n Muhammad the party of nobles
opposed to Mehm&uacute;d, concealing the fact of Muhammad&rsquo;s
death, sent word that Muhammad had ordered him immediately to the
palace, as he wanted to send him on an embassy to Gujar√°t.
Mehm&uacute;d, who knew that the Sult√°n was dead, returned word
to the nobles that he had vowed a life-long seclusion as the sweeper of
the shrine of his patron Sult√°n Hoshang, but that if the nobles
came to him and convinced him that the good of his country depended on
his going to Gujar√°t he was ready to go and see Sult√°n
Muhammad. The nobles were caught in their own trap. They went to
Mehm&uacute;d and were secured and imprisoned by him.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n360.1src">&uarr;</a></p>

Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n: The Sult√°ns of M√°ndu had
reached such a pitch of luxury and ease that it is impossible to
imagine aught exceeding it. Among them Sult√°n
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n was so famous for his luxurious habits, that
at present (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1611) if any one exceeds
in luxury and pleasure, they say he is a second
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n. The orders of the Sult√°n were that
no event of a painful nature or one in which there was any touch of
sadness should be related to him. They say that during his entire reign
news of a sad nature was only twice conveyed to him: once when his
son-in-law died and once when his daughter was brought before him
clothed in white. On this occasion the Sult√°n is related to have
simply said: &ldquo;Perhaps her husband is dead.&rdquo; This he said
because the custom of the people of India is that when the husband of a
woman dies she gives up wearing coloured clothes. The second occasion
was when the army of Sult√°n Bahlol Lodi plundered several of the
districts of Chanderi. Though it was necessary to report this to the
Sult√°n, his ministers were unable to communicate it to him. They
therefore asked a band of actors (<i>bh√°nds</i>) to assume the
dress of Afgh√°ns, and mentioning the districts to represent them
as being pillaged and laid waste. Sult√°n
Ghi√°s-ud-d&iacute;n exclaimed in surprise: &ldquo;But is the
governor of Chanderi dead that he does not avenge upon the
Afgh√°ns the ruin of his country!&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

round it were many apartments. When Sult√°n Muzaffar placed his

apparelled and jewelled, all at once opened the doors of <span class="corr" id="xd25e32964" title="Source: thier">their</span> chambers and

eyes fell on their charms he bowed his head and said: &ldquo;To see

Sult√°n Mehm&uacute;d replied: &ldquo;These are mine, and

old meaning of things carried, that is baggage. The time taken favours
the view that wagons or carts were forced up the hill. For the early
seventeenth century use of carriages in its modern sense compare Terry
(Voyage, 161). Of our wagons drawn with oxen &hellip; and other
carriages we made a ring every night; also Dodsworth (1614), who
describes a band of <span class="corr" id="xd25e33894" title="Source: R√°jp&uacute;ts">R√°jputs</span> near Baroda
cutting off two of his carriages (Kerr&rsquo;s Voyages, IX. 203); and
Roe (1616), who journeyed from Ajm&iacute;r to M√°ndu with twenty
camels four carts and two coaches (Kerr, IX. 308). Terry&rsquo;s
carriages seem to be Roe&rsquo;s coaches, to which Dela Valle

described by Strabo (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;50) covered with
crimson silk fringed with yellow about the roof and the curtains.
Compare Idr&iacute;si (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1100&ndash;1150), but probably from Al Istakhiri,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;960: Elliot, I. 87). In all Nahrwala
or north Gujar√°t the only mode of carrying either passengers or
goods is in chariots drawn by oxen with harness and traces under the
control of a driver. When in 1616 Jeh√°ng&iacute;r left
Ajm&iacute;r for M√°ndu the English carriage presented to him by
the English ambassador Sir Thomas Roe was allotted to the
Sult√°nah N&uacute;r Jeh√°n Begam. It was driven by an
English coachman. Jeh√°ng&iacute;r followed in the coach his own
men had made in imitation of the English coach. Corryat (1615,
Crudities III., Letters from India, unpaged) calls the English chariot
a gallant coach of 150 pounds price.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n376.3src">&uarr;</a></p>

84. Corryat&rsquo;s Master Herbert was as already noticed named like
the traveller Thomas. The two Thomases were distant relations, both
being fourth in descent from Sir Richard Herbert of Colebroke, who
lived about the middle of the fifteenth century. A further connection
between the two families is the copy of complimentary verses &ldquo;To
my cousin Sir Thomas Herbert,&rdquo; signed Ch. Herbert, in the 1634
and 1665 editions of Herbert&rsquo;s Travels, which are naturally,
though somewhat doubtfully, ascribed to Charles Herbert, a brother of
our Master Thomas. It is therefore probable that after his return to
England Sir Thomas Herbert obtained the M√°ndu details from
Master Thomas who was himself a writer, the author of several poems and
pamphlets. Corryat&rsquo;s tale how, during the water-famine at
M√°ndu, Master Herbert annexed a spring or cistern, and then
bound a servant of the Great King who attempted to share in its use,
shows admirable courage and resolution on the part of Master Thomas,
then a youth of twenty years. The details of Thomas in his brother Lord
Herbert&rsquo;s autobiography give additional interest to the hero of
Corryat&rsquo;s tale of a Tank. Master Thomas was born in. <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1597. In 1610, when a page to Sir Edward Cecil
and a boy of thirteen, in the German War especially in the siege of
Juliers fifteen miles north-east of Aix-la-Chapelle, Master Thomas
showed such forwardness as no man in that great army surpassed. On his
voyage to India in 1617, in a fight with a great Portuguese carrack,
Captain Joseph, in command of Herbert&rsquo;s ship <i>Globe</i>, was
killed. Thomas took Joseph&rsquo;s place, forced the carrack aground,
and so riddled her with shot that she never floated again. To his
brother&rsquo;s visit to India Lord Herbert refers as a year spent with
the merchants who went from Surat to the Great Mughal. After his return
to England Master Thomas distinguished himself at Algiers, capturing a
vessel worth &pound;1800. In 1622, when Master Thomas was in command of
one of the ships sent to fetch Prince Charles (afterwards King Charles
I.) from Spain, during the return voyage certain Low Countrymen and
Dunkirkers, that is Dutch and Spanish vessels, offended the
Prince&rsquo;s dignity by fighting in his presence without his leave.
The Prince ordered the fighting ships to be separated; whereupon Master
Thomas, with some other ships got betwixt the fighters on either side,
and shot so long that both Low Countrymen and Dunkirkers were glad to
desist. Afterwards at divers times Thomas fought with great courage and
success with divers men in single fight, sometimes hurting and
disarming his adversary, sometimes driving him away. The end of Master
Thomas was sad. Finding his proofs of himself undervalued he retired
into a private and melancholy life, and after living in this sullen
humour for many years, he died about 1642 and was buried in London in
St. Martin&rsquo;s near Charing Cross.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n381.7src">&uarr;</a></p>

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> It will be evident from
what has been related in the Musalm√°n portion of this history
that long before 1760, the Mar√°th√°s had a firm foothold
in Gujar√°t, and were able to dictate to the local chiefs the
policy of the Dakhan Court. Long before 1819 too, Mar√°tha
influence was on the wane before the rising fortunes of the British.
Between these two dates however is comprised the whole or nearly the
whole of the period during which the Mar√°th√°s were
virtually paramount in Gujar√°t. From each of these two dates the
political history took a new departure, and on this account they serve
respectively to denote the starting point and terminus of
Mar√°tha supremacy. Most of what took place before 1760 is so
interwoven with the interests and intrigues of the Muhammadan delegates
of the court of Dehli that it has been fully described in the history
of the Musalm√°n Period. It is however necessary, in order to
trace the growth of Mar√°tha power, to briefly set forth in a
continuous narrative the events in which this race was principally
concerned, adding such as transpired independently of Musalm√°n
politics. This task is rendered easier by the very nature of
Mar√°tha policy, which has left little to be recorded of its
action in Gujar√°t beyond the deeds and fortunes of its
initiators and their adherents.</p>
<p>The connection of the Mar√°th√°s with Gujar√°t can
be divided by the chronicler into the following periods. First, the
time of predatory inroads from 1664 to 1743, before the leaders of
these expeditions had permanently established themselves within the
province. Secondly, what may be termed the mercenary period, when the
Mar√°th√°s partly by independent action, but far more by a
course of judicious interference in the quarrels of the Muhammadan
officials and by loans of troops, had acquired considerable territorial
advantages. Towards the end of this period, as has been already seen,
their aid was usually sufficient to ensure the success of the side
which had managed to secure it, and at last the capital itself was
claimed and held by them. Then came the time of domination, from 1760
to 1801, during which period the G√°ikw√°r influence was
occasionally greater than that of the Peshwa. From 1802, internal
dissensions at the courts of Poona and Baroda weakened the hold the
Mar√°th√°s had on the province, and the paramount power had
to all intents and purposes passed over to the British long before the
downfall of B√°jir√°v Peshwa and the final annexation of
his rights and territory in 1819. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386"
href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> Shortly after, when the
G√°ikw√°r made over to the British the work of collecting
the tribute from K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, Mar√°tha
supremacy came to an end.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s First Inroad,
1664.</span>The first Mar√°tha force that made its appearance in
Gujar√°t was led there early in 1664 by &#346;iv√°ji. This
leader was at the time engaged in a warfare with the Mughals, which,
however desultory, required him to keep up a much larger force than
could be supported out of the revenues of his dominions. He therefore
looked to plunder to supply the deficiency, and Surat, then the richest
town of Western India, was marked down by him as an easy prey. His mode
of attack was cautious. He first sent one Bahirji N√°ik to spy
out the country and report the chances of a rich booty, whilst he
himself moved a force up to Junnar on pretence of visiting some forts
in that direction recently acquired by one of his subordinates. On
receiving a favourable report from Bahirji, &#346;iv√°ji gave out
that he was going to perform religious ceremonies at N√°sik, and
taking with him 4000 picked horsemen, he marched suddenly down the
Gh√°ts and through the D√°ng jungles, and appeared before
Surat. There he found an insignificant garrison, so he rested outside
the city six days whilst his men plundered at their leisure. On hearing
of the tardy approach of a relieving force sent by the governor of
Ahmed√°b√°d, &#346;iv√°ji beat a retreat with all his
booty to the stronghold of R√°ygad. By the time the reinforcement
reached Surat, the only trace of the invaders was the emptied coffers
of the inhabitants. About the same time, or shortly after, the fleet
which &#346;iv√°ji had equipped at Alib√°g about two years
before came up to the mouth of the gulf of Cambay and carried off one
or two Mughal ships which were conveying to Makka large numbers of
pilgrims with their rich oblations.<a class="noteref" id="n386.1src"
href="#n386.1" name="n386.1src">1</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s Second Attack,
1670.</span>This insult to the Muhammadan religion was enough to
incense the bigoted Aurangzeb, apart from the additional offences of
the sack of Surat and the assumption in 1665 of royal insignia by
&#346;iv√°ji. He therefore sent an expedition to the Dakhan
strong enough to keep the Mar√°th√°s for some time away
from Gujar√°t. One of &#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s officers,
however, seems to have attacked a part of the Surat district in 1666,
and to have got off safely with his spoils. In 1670, &#346;iv√°ji
again descended upon that city with about 15,000 men. The only serious
resistance he experienced was, as before, from the English factors. He
plundered the town for three days, and only left on receiving some
information about the Mughals&rsquo; movements in the Dakhan, which
made him fear lest he should be intercepted on his way back to the
country about the Gh√°ts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1671.</span>&#346;iv√°ji left a claim
for twelve l√°khs of rupees to be paid as a guarantee against
future expeditions. It is possible, however, that as he does not appear
to have taken any immediate steps to recover this sum, the demand was
made only in accordance with Mar√°tha policy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> which looked upon a
country once overrun as tributary, and assumed a right to exercise
paramount authority over it by virtue of the completed act of a
successful invasion. In 1671 the Mar√°tha fleet was ordered to
sail up the gulf and plunder Broach, and it is probable that
&#346;iv√°ji intended at the same time to levy tribute from
Surat, but the whole expedition was countermanded before the ships
sailed.</p>
<p>The conduct of the military authorities in Gujar√°t with
regard to this expedition of 1670 was such as to render it highly
probable that the Mughal leaders were in complicity with the
Mar√°th√°s in order to gain the favour and support of their
leader. Shortly before &#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s arrival there had
been a large garrison in Surat, apparently kept there by the governor,
who suspected that some attempt on the town would soon be made. This
garrison was withdrawn before &#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s attack, and
almost immediately after his departure 5000 men were sent back again.
The commanders of the Mughal army in the Dakhan were Jasvant Singh the
R√°htor chief of Jodhpur and prince Muazzam. Jasvant Singh had
been viceroy of Gujar√°t from <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1659 to 1662, and in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1671 shortly after &#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s
second expedition was re-appointed to that post for three years. He
had, moreover, been accused of taking bribes from &#346;iv√°ji
during the operations in the Dakhan. Prince Muazzam, again, had every
reason for wishing to secure to himself so powerful an ally as
&#346;iv√°ji in the struggle for the imperial crown that took
place, as a rule, at every succession. Aurangzeb, reasoning from his
own experiences as a son, refused to allow a possible heir to his
throne to become powerful at court; and accordingly sent him against
&#346;iv√°ji with an army quite inadequate for such operations.
It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that if there had not been
some previous understanding between &#346;iv√°ji and the Mughal
leaders, the troops that were known to be within easy reach of Surat
would have been found strong and numerous enough either to have
repulsed him altogether or at least to have prevented the three
days&rsquo; sack of the city.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">S√°ler Taken, 1672.</span>In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1672 &#346;iv√°ji took some of
the small forts to the south of Surat, such as P√°rnera and
Bagv√°da, now in the P√°rdi sub-division of the Surat
district, whilst Moro Trimal got possession of the large fort of
S√°ler in B√°gl√°n, which guarded one of the most
frequented passes from the Dakhan into Gujar√°t. The
Mar√°th√°s were thus able to command the routes along which
their expeditions could most conveniently be despatched.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Narbada Crossed, 1675.</span>No further
incursion was made till 1675, in which year a Mar√°tha force
first crossed the Narbada. On the resumption of hostilities between
&#346;iv√°ji and the Mughals, Has√°ji Mohite, who had been
made Sen√°pati, with the title of Hambirr√°v, marched up
the North Konkan, and divided his army into two forces near Surat. One
portion plundered towards Burh√°npur, the other commanded by
himself plundered the Broach district. Ten years later a successful
expedition was made against Broach itself, either preconcerted or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> actually led by a younger
son of Aurangzeb, who had taken refuge with the Mar√°th√°s.
Broach was plundered, and the booty safely carried off before the local
force could get near the invaders. Gujar√°t was now left free
from inroad for some fourteen years, probably because the attention of
the Mar√°tha leaders was concentrated on their quarrels in the
Dakhan.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Raids by D√°bh√°de,
1699.</span>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1699 R√°m
R√°ja appointed one of his most trusted officers,
Khander√°v D√°bh√°de, to collect in
B√°gl√°n the <i>chauth</i><a class="noteref" id="n388.1src"
href="#n388.1" name="n388.1src">2</a> and <i>sardeshmukhi</i> imposts
which had by that time become regularly instituted. This chief, whose
name was afterwards so intimately connected with Gujar√°t, not
only collected all that was due to his master from the village officers
in B√°gl√°n, but also made an incursion into the Surat
districts on his own account. <span class="marginnote">1700&ndash;1704.</span>Between 1700 and 1704
Khander√°v attempted two expeditions, but was foiled by the
vigilance of the Mughal authorities. <span class="marginnote">1705.</span>In 1705, however, he made a raid on a large
scale and got safely across the Narbada, where he defeated two
Muhammadan detachments sent against him, and got back to S√°ler
with his booty. <span class="marginnote">1706&ndash;1711.</span>Khander√°v now kept bodies of
troops constantly hovering on the outskirts of Gujar√°t and along
the road to Burh√°npur. He himself led several expeditions into
the Ahmed√°b√°d territory, and is said to have once got as
far as Sorath in the peninsula, where however he was repelled by the
Musalm√°n governor. In 1711, again he was severely defeated by
the Mughals near Anklesvar in the Broach district, and had to withdraw
to the borders of Kh√°ndesh.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1713.</span>In 1713 some treasure was being
conveyed from Surat to Aurang√°b√°d escorted by a large
force under Muhammad Tabr&iacute;z&iacute;. The party was attacked in
the jungles east of Surat and the treasure carried off. Just before
this, Sarbuland Kh√°n, the deputy viceroy, on his way to take up
his office at Ahmed√°b√°d, was attacked and robbed in the
wilds of S√°gb√°ra on the north bank of the T√°pti.
As Khander√°v had a short while previous to these occurrences
taken up his position near N√°ndod<a class="noteref" id="n388.2src" href="#n388.2" name="n388.2src">3</a> in the
R√°jpipla territory, it is probably to him or to his subordinates
that these raids are to be attributed. He managed by a system of
outposts to cut off communication between Surat and Burh√°npur,
except for those who had paid him a fee for safe conduct. If this
charge was evaded or resisted, he appropriated one-fourth of the
property that the traveller was conveying up country.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">D√°bh√°de, 1716.</span>As the
Burh√°npur road was one of those most frequented by both pilgrims
and merchants, the Dehli authorities were obliged, in 1716, to organize
an expedition against D√°bh√°de. The leader of the force
was one Zulfikar Beg, an officer inexperienced in Mar√°tha
warfare. D√°bh√°de found little difficulty in decoying him
into a mountainous country, and there completely defeated him with the
usual Mar√°tha accompaniment of plunder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> <span class="marginnote">D√°bh√°de Sen√°pati.</span>Finding
himself once more in the Dakhan, Khander√°v D√°bh√°de
took the opportunity of rejoining the court at S√°t√°ra,
from which he had long been absent. He was lucky enough to arrive just
as the Sen√°pati Man√°ji Mor√°r had failed on an
important expedition and was consequently in disgrace. R√°ja
Sh√°hu, pleased with Khander√°v&rsquo;s recent success
against the Delhi troops, divested Man√°ji of the title of
Sen√°pati, and bestowed it upon the more fortunate leader.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Peshwa&rsquo;s Negotiations,

three years, accompanying, meanwhile, <span class="corr" id="xd25e34623" title="Source: B√°laji">B√°l√°ji</span>
Vishvan√°th the Peshwa to Dehli, where the latter was engaged in
negotiations for the confirmation of the Mar√°tha rights to
<i>chauth</i> and other tribute from certain districts in the
Dakhan.</p>
<p>It is evident that at this time there was no definite claim to
tribute from Gujar√°t on the part of the Mar√°tha
government; for in spite of the intrigues of B√°l√°ji and
the weakness of the court party at Delhi no concessions were obtained
with regard to it, although the Mar√°tha dues from other parts of
the country were fully ratified. The grounds on which
B√°l√°ji demanded the tribute from Gujar√°t were that
Sh√°hu would thereby gain the right to restrain the excesses of
Mar√°tha freebooters from the frontier and would guarantee the
whole country against irregular pillage. The argument was a curious
one, considering that the most troublesome and notorious freebooter of
the whole tribe was at the elbow of the envoy, who was so strenuously
pleading for the right to suppress him. It is probable that
B√°l√°ji foresaw that Khander√°v&rsquo;s newly
acquired rank would take him for a time from B√°gl√°n to
the court, so that meanwhile an arrangement could be made to prevent
the growth of any powerful chief in the Gujar√°t direction who
might interfere with the plans of the central government. The
Mar√°tha statesman was as anxious to ensure the subordination of
distant feudatories as the Mughals to secure the freedom of the
Gh√°t roads to the coast.</p>
<p>In the redistribution of authority carried out about this time by
B√°l√°ji Vishvan√°th, the responsibility of
collecting the Mar√°tha dues<a class="noteref" id="n389.1src"
href="#n389.1" name="n389.1src">4</a> from Gujar√°t and
B√°gl√°n was assigned to Khander√°v as <span class="corr" id="xd25e34641" title="Source: Sen√°p√°ti">Sen√°pati</span> or
commander-in-chief; but as these dues were not yet settled, at least as
regards the country below the Gh√°ts, Khander√°v seems to
have remained with the Peshwa in the field.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r,

Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, one of the officers of Khander√°v, by name
D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, so distinguished himself
that the Sen√°pati brought his conduct prominently to the notice
of R√°ja Sh√°hu. The latter promoted D√°m√°ji
to be second in command to Khander√°v with the title of Shamsher
Bah√°dur, which had been formerly borne by one of the Atole
family in 1692. This is the first mention of the present ruling family
of Baroda. Before many months both Khander√°v and
D√°m√°ji died. The former was succeeded by his son
Trimbakr√°v, on whom his father&rsquo;s title was conferred.
Pil√°ji, nephew of D√°m√°ji, was confirmed in his
uncle&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Gujar√°t. As soon as he could collect a sufficiently strong
force, he attacked the Surat district and defeated the Musalm√°n
commander close to the city itself. After extorting from him a handsome
sum as ransom, Pil√°ji returned eastwards. He selected
Songad,<a class="noteref" id="n390.1src" href="#n390.1" name="n390.1src">5</a> a fort about fifty miles east of Surat, as his
headquarters, and from thence made continual excursions against the
neighbouring towns. He once attacked Surat, but although he defeated
the Mughal leader, he seems to have contented himself with
contributions levied from the adjacent country, and not to have entered
the town. Pil√°ji soon obtained possession of some strongholds in
the <span class="marginnote">1723.</span>R√°jpipla country
between N√°ndod and S√°gb√°ra, which he fortified, as
Khander√°v D√°bh√°de had formerly done. Here he
resided as representative of the Sen√°pati, whose family had
removed for a while to the Dakhan. The tribute collected from
B√°gl√°n and Gujar√°t was supposed to be transmitted
by Pil√°ji to the royal treasury through the Peshwa; but there is
no record of these dues having been levied with any regularity or even
fixed at any special amount. Whilst Trimbakr√°v was taking an
active part in the affairs of his royal patron in the Dakhan,
Pil√°ji occupied himself in sedulously cultivating the goodwill
of the border tribes surrounding his residence in Gujar√°t.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha Tribute, 1723.</span>The
year 1723 is noteworthy as being the date of the first imposition of
the regular Mar√°tha demand of one-fourth, <i>chauth</i>, and
one-tenth, <i>sardeshmukhi</i>, of the revenue of Gujar√°t.
Whilst Pil√°ji was directing his attacks against Surat and the
south of the province another of R√°ja Sh√°hu&rsquo;s
officers, who had been sent up towards M√°lwa, entered
Gujar√°t by the north-east, and after ravaging the country round
Dohad,<a class="noteref" id="n390.2src" href="#n390.2" name="n390.2src">6</a> settled a fixed tribute on the district.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kant√°ji Kadam.</span>This officer,
Kant√°ji Kadam B√°nde, was soon after engaged by one of the
parties struggling for the viceroyalty of Ahmed√°b√°d to
bring his cavalry into the province and take part in the civil war. The
leader of the opposite party, Rustam Ali, enlisted the services of
Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r. The Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, whose
influence in the Dakhan was very great, managed to detach Pil√°ji
from Rustam Ali&rsquo;s side. This was the easier, as Rustam had
already defeated Pil√°ji more than once in attacks by the latter
against Surat, of which district Rustam was governor. There are two
different accounts<a class="noteref" id="n390.3src" href="#n390.3"
name="n390.3src">7</a> of what took place when the rival forces came
into action, but both show clearly that the Mar√°tha leaders
acted on both sides with utter disregard of their agreements and looked
only to plundering the Muhammadan camps whilst the soldiers were
engaged in battle. After the defeat of Rustam, the two Mar√°tha
chiefs joined forces and proceeded to levy <i>chauth</i>, of which the
Mughal deputy had granted Pil√°ji a share equal to that of his
first ally Kant√°ji.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha Dissensions,
1725.</span>This division led to quarrels and at last to an open
rupture between the two Mar√°tha leaders, which was only patched
up by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> grant of the
<i>chauth</i> north of the Mahi river to Kant√°ji and of that to
the south to Pil√°ji. The chief ground of quarrel seems to have
been the relative position of the G√°ikw√°r as agent for
the Sen√°pati, who had a right to collect all dues from
Gujar√°t, and of Kant√°ji, who claimed superior rank as
holding his commission direct from R√°ja Sh√°hu. On hearing
of this dispute and the consequent partition of the Mar√°tha
tribute, <span class="corr" id="xd25e34710" title="Source: Trimbakrav">Trimbakr√°v</span> D√°bh√°de
himself hastened up to Cambay with an army, but effected nothing, and
seems to have retired, leaving Pil√°ji to look after his
interests at Ahmed√°b√°d. Both the latter, however, and
Kant√°ji soon after withdrew from Gujar√°t, but were within
a short period encouraged to return by the success of a raid made by
another leader, Ant√°ji Bh√°skar, on the north-east
district. They both joined Hamid Kh√°n in his resistance to the
new viceroy, but received several checks from the Muhammadan army, and
after plundering again returned to their strongholds for the rainy
season.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Peshwa, 1726.</span>Next year they
returned for the tribute and plundered as usual. The Peshwa
B√°jir√°v then opened for the first time direct
negotiations with the viceroy of Gujar√°t. The rapid increase of
the authority of the Br√°hman ministers at the
R√°ja&rsquo;s court in the Dakhan had aroused the jealousy of the
Mar√°tha nobles, amongst whom Trimbakr√°v
D√°bh√°de was one of the most influential.
B√°jir√°v, being fully aware of the fact, and having by
this time acquired from the R√°ja the power of acting with
foreign powers independently of the throne, determined to undermine
Trimbakr√°v&rsquo;s authority in Gujar√°t by aiming at the
rights said to have been formally granted to him by Hamid Kh√°n
over the country south of the Mahi. He therefore applied to the viceroy
for a confirmation of the right to levy <i>chauth</i> and
<i>sardeshmukhi</i> over the whole country, on condition that he would
protect it from the inroads of Kant√°ji, Pil√°ji, and other
irresponsible freebooters. The viceroy had still some resources left at
his disposal and was in hopes that his repeated applications to Dehli
for assistance would soon meet with a favourable answer. <span class="marginnote">Cession of Tribute, 1728.</span>He declined therefore to
accede to B√°jir√°v&rsquo;s proposals at once, on the
grounds that the court at Dehli had repudiated the concessions made to
Pil√°ji and Kant√°ji by his predecessor&rsquo;s deputy. As
however the depredations on the frontier caused serious injury both to
the revenues and the people, he allowed the Peshwa to send a feudatory,
Ud√°ji Pav√°r, chief of Dh√°r, through the Mughal
territories to operate against Pil√°ji. The latter, who was fully
aware of these negotiations, persuaded Kant√°ji to join him in
expelling the agents of the Peshwa party, as it was clear that if
Pil√°ji&rsquo;s forces were scattered the way would be open for
Ud√°ji to attack Kant√°ji himself. The two then proceeded
to Baroda and after a while drove back Ud√°ji, and occupied
Baroda and Dabhoi. Here Pil√°ji remained, and next year
Kant√°ji succeeded in taking Ch√°mp√°ner, thus
advancing his posts nearer the centre of the province. With such an
advantage gained these two chiefs instituted raids still more
frequently than before. In these straits, and finding himself utterly
neglected by the emperor, the viceroy re-opened negotiations with the
Peshwa, who lost no time in sending his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

with an army through Gujar√°t. <span class="corr" id="xd25e34743"
title="Source: Petlad">Petl√°d</span> and Dholka were plundered,
but Kant√°ji was left undisturbed, so he took this opportunity of
marching to Sorath, where he remained for some time extorting tribute.
The viceroy agreed formally to cede the <i><span class="corr" id="xd25e34747" title="Source: sardesmukhi">sardeshmukhi</span></i> of the
whole revenue, land and customs (with the exception of the port of
Surat and the districts attached to it) and the <i>chauth</i> of the
same district, with five per cent on the revenue from the city of
Ahmed√°b√°d. Special clauses were inserted in the grant of
<i>chauth</i> to suit the convenience of both the Peshwa and the
viceroy. The latter stipulated that as few collectors as possible
should be kept by the Mar√°th√°s in the districts under
tribute, and that no extra demands beyond the one-fourth should be
made. He also insisted that the percentage should be calculated on the
actual collections and not on the <i>kam√°l</i> or highest sum
recorded as having been collected.<a class="noteref" id="n392.1src"
href="#n392.1" name="n392.1src">8</a> The Mar√°th√°s were
also to support the imperial authority and to keep up a body of horse.
The Peshwa agreed (probably at his own request) to prevent all
Mar√°tha subjects from joining disaffected chiefs, or other
turbulent characters, thus receiving the right to suppress
Kant√°ji and Pil√°ji, as well as the Bhils and Kolis with
whom the latter was on such friendly terms.</p>
<p>After this agreement was executed, B√°jir√°v made over
part of the <i>sardeshmukhi</i> to the D√°bh√°de, as well
as the <i>mok&acirc;sa</i> or three-fourths of the <i>svar√°j</i>
as settled by B√°l√°ji Vishvan√°th. The consideration
as set forth in the preamble of this agreement was the great
improvement effected by the Mar√°tha rulers as regards the wealth
and tranquillity of the Dakhan provinces. This was inserted either to
give the transaction the appearance of having been executed on the part
of the emperor (for otherwise the viceroy had no concern in the state
of the Dakhan), or simply as an expression of gratitude on the part of
this special viceroy towards the Mar√°th√°s who had just
brought to terms the Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, his former rival and enemy.
It is even probable that it was merely intended, as usual with such
preambles, to veil the forced nature of the treaty.</p>
<p>The hostile movements of the Pratinidhi in the Southern
Mar√°tha Country induced the Peshwa to return to the Dakhan.
Kant√°ji returned from Sorath to Ch√°mp√°ner,
plundering part of the viceroy&rsquo;s camp on his way.
Trimbakr√°v D√°bh√°de, jealous of the interference of
the Peshwa in the affairs of Gujar√°t, began to intrigue with
other chiefs to overturn the power of the Br√°hman ministers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Coalition against the Peshwa,
1730.</span>As soon as Niz√°m-ul-Mulk became aware of this
discontent on the part of Trimbakr√°v, of whose power he was well
informed, he proposed to assist him by an attack on the Peshwa from the
east, whilst the Mar√°th√°s operated in another direction.
Trimbakr√°v was successful in his overtures with Pil√°ji
G√°ikw√°r, the B√°nde, the Pav√°rs, and a few
other chiefs resident in Kh√°ndesh or the north Dakhan. The
troops sent by them to join his standard soon amounted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> to 35,000 men, who were
collected in Gujar√°t. He then gave out that he was bent on
rescuing the Mar√°tha R√°ja from the thraldom in which he
was being kept by the Br√°hmans. The Peshwa, who had discovered
the intercourse between Trimbakr√°v and the Niz√°m,
proclaimed this treason on the part of the D√°bh√°de as a
royal officer, and stated that the malcontents were only planning the
partition of the inheritance of Shiv√°ji between the R√°ja
of Kolh√°pur and themselves. As soon as he found the
Niz√°m&rsquo;s troops were on the march, he collected his picked
men and advanced on the D√°bh√°de in Gujar√°t.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Defeat of the Allies, 1731.</span>The
Peshwa&rsquo;s army was inferior in numbers but consisted of better
trained men. He closed at once with the allies near Dabhoi, and easily
defeated the undisciplined forces of the Pav√°rs and
B√°nde. The D√°bh√°de&rsquo;s army, however, had more
experience of regular warfare and made a stand. But a stray shot killed
Trimbakr√°v as he was endeavouring to rally the forces of his
allies, and as usual in such engagements, the loss of the leader
disheartened the army. Utter confusion ensued, in which many of the
nobles fell, others ran away, and the Peshwa, without the necessity of
pushing further his advantage, made good his retreat to the Dakhan. The
Niz√°m, who was in pursuit, only managed to capture some of the
baggage with the rear guard as it was crossing the T√°pti near
Surat.<a class="noteref" id="n393.1src" href="#n393.1" name="n393.1src">9</a></p>
<p>Safe again in the Dakhan, the Peshwa at once began negotiations with
both the Niz√°m and the adherents of Trimbakr√°v
D√°bh√°de. He recognized the rights of the former to some
possessions in Gujar√°t independent of the viceroy of
Ahmed√°b√°d, and agreed to further his designs of severing
the Dakhan from the possessions of the emperor. He conciliated the
D√°bh√°de family by establishing at Poona an annual
distribution of food and presents to Br√°hmans such as had
formerly been the practice in the native village of
Khander√°v.<a class="noteref" id="n393.2src" href="#n393.2" name="n393.2src">10</a> This institution was known as Dakshin√°.</p>
<p>B√°jir√°v acquiesced also in the general tendency
amongst Mar√°th√°s of all offices to become hereditary, and
conferred the title of Sen√°pati on Yeshvantr√°v the minor
son of the deceased Trimbakr√°v. The widow Um√°b√°i
became guardian, and Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r deputy or
<i>mut√°lik</i> in Gujar√°t. This latter appointment seems
to have been made by the Peshwa and not by the D√°bh√°de,
for Pil√°ji received at the same time a new title, namely that of
<i>Sen√° Kh√°s Khel</i> or commander of the special band or
perhaps the household brigade. He was also bound on behalf of the
Sen√°pati to respect the Peshwa&rsquo;s rights in M√°lwa
and Gujar√°t, and to pay half the collections from the territory
he administered to the royal treasury through the minister. A provision
was also inserted with regard to future acquisitions. This reciprocal
agreement was executed at the special command of the Mar√°tha
R√°ja Sh√°hu, who had not yet quite abrogated his authority
in favour of the Peshwa. Pil√°ji after these negotiations retired
to Gujar√°t. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394"

dwelling in the wild parts of the eastern frontier made Pil√°ji
an object of hatred and fear to the Mughal viceroy, who had him
assassinated by one of his adherents whilst the latter was pretending
to whisper some important and confidential news in
Pil√°ji&rsquo;s ear. This event took place at D√°kor in the
Kaira district. The followers of the G√°ikw√°r slew the
assassin and retired south of the Mahi. They were driven by the Mughals
out of Baroda, but continued to hold Dabhoi. D√°m√°ji
G√°ikw√°r, son of Pil√°ji, was at this time prowling
round Surat watching for an opportunity of interfering in the disturbed
affairs of that town. One of the candidates for the governorship had
offered him one-fourth the revenue of the city for his assistance, but
the expedition was deferred on account of the appointment of a rival by
the emperor. D√°m√°ji therefore was preparing to act on his
own account independently of his ally. The news of his father&rsquo;s
assassination, however, took him northwards. He found that the
Des√°i of P√°dra near Baroda had stirred up the Bhils and
Kolis to revolt, in order to give the relations of Pil√°ji a
chance of striking a blow at the murderers of their deceased leader.
<span class="marginnote">1733.</span>Um√°b√°i

<p><span class="marginnote">G√°ikw√°rs Secure Baroda,

Baroda during the absence of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi the governor.
Since that date this town has been the capital of the

extorted from the latter a considerable sum as ransom.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Mar√°tha Deputy Governor,

her agent in succession to Pil√°ji; but as she required
D√°m√°ji in the Dakhan the latter had been obliged to leave
in his turn a <i>locum tenens</i> in Gujar√°t. There ensued
quarrels between this deputy, named Rangoji, and <span class="corr" id="xd25e34845" title="Source: Kantaji">K√°nt√°ji</span> Kadam
which brought D√°m√°ji back again, and after obtaining from
the Muhammadan viceroy, who had espoused the cause of Kant√°ji, a
grant of one-fourth the revenues of the country north of the Mahi he
went as usual to Sorath. Kant√°ji Kadam, who as a partisan of the
Peshwa was hostile to the Sen√°pati, harassed the country within
reach of his frontier. D√°m√°ji, meanwhile, had again
proceeded to the Dakhan, where Um√°b√°i was intriguing
against the Peshwa and required all the help she could obtain to
further the ambitious schemes she was devising in the name of her
half-witted son. His deputy Rangoji, by demanding a heavy price for his
aid at a time when an aspirant to the viceroyalty of
Ahmed√°b√°d was in distress, managed to secure for the
Mar√°th√°s half the revenue of Gujar√°t with certain
exceptions.</p>

plundering them. The events of this year have been detailed in full in
the history of the Musalm√°n Period. After getting possession of
a great part of the city of Ahmed√°b√°d the <span class="marginnote">1739.</span>Mar√°th√°s, by their oppressive
rule, excited a rising amongst the Musalm√°n inhabitants. Similar
quarrels and subsequent reconciliations took place between 1739 and
1741, the Musalm√°ns distrusting the Mar√°th√°s, yet
not daring to attempt to oust them. D√°m√°ji, on his way
back from one of his Sorath expeditions, laid <span class="marginnote">1741.</span>siege to Broach, which was held by a
Muhammadan officer direct from the viceroy of the Dakhan.<a class="noteref" id="n395.1src" href="#n395.1" name="n395.1src">11</a> As the
latter personage was still regarded by the Mar√°tha chiefs as a
possible ally against the Peshwa, D√°m√°ji at once obeyed
the request of the Niz√°m to raise the siege, but probably
obtained a promise of future concessions such as he had acquired at
Surat.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1742.</span>Rangoji in the absence of
D√°m√°ji took up his residence in Borsad. There he fell
into several disputes with the Muhammadan officials, in the course of
one of which he was taken prisoner, but escaped the next year (1743).
Meanwhile D√°m√°ji had joined with R√°ghoji
Bhonsl&eacute; in attacking the Peshwa. Whilst R√°ghoji was
preparing his army in the east, D√°m√°ji made a feint
against M√°lwa, which had the desired effect of withdrawing a
large portion of the ministerial army. The
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s troops retreated without giving battle,
but to prevent any future junction between D√°m√°ji and the
Bhonsl&eacute; party in Ber√°r, B√°l√°ji Peshwa
confirmed the Pav√°r family in their claims to Dh√°r, which
had never been acknowledged as their territory since the defection of
the Pav√°rs to the D√°bh√°de party in 1731. It is
worth remarking that though the rank of Sen√°pati had apparently
been made hereditary in the D√°bh√°de family (for the owner
of the title was quite unfit for the command of an army), the
Ghorpad&eacute; family applied at this time to have it restored to them
on the ground that it once had been held by one of their house. The
Peshwa, however, managed to secure their alliance by a grant of land,
and their claims to the chief command of the army seem to have been
waived.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1743&ndash;44.</span>For the next two years
the Mar√°tha force in Gujar√°t under Rangoji and
Dev√°ji T√°kpar was employed by the Musalm√°ns in
their quarrels regarding the viceroyalty. The Mar√°tha practice
of appointing deputies gives rise to some confusion as to the
negotiations that took place about this time between the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s party and the rival candidates for the
office of subhed√°r. For instance, Um√°b√°i
D√°bh√°de had appointed the G√°ikw√°r family as
her agents-in-chief, but the principal members of that house were
absent in the Dakhan. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r had
appointed Rangoji, who in his turn left one Krishn√°ji in charge
of the Mar√°tha share of the city of Ahmed√°b√°d. On
the departure, however, of D√°m√°ji from Gujar√°t,
Um√°b√°i left R√°m√°ji as her agent.

<p><span class="marginnote">1745.</span>On Khander√°v
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s return from the Dakhan he demanded the

being satisfied with this agent confined him in Borsad and appointed
one Trimbakr√°v in his place. Um√°b√°i caused Rangoji
to be set at liberty and sent to her in the Dakhan, after which she
reappointed him her agent. He expelled Trimbakr√°v from
Ahmed√°b√°d, but was attacked by Krishn√°ji and
Gang√°dhar, two other late deputies. D√°m√°ji and
Khander√°v were obliged at last to come to Gujar√°t and
summon all these deputies to their presence. A private arrangement was
concluded under which Khander√°v was allowed by
D√°m√°ji to keep Na&#7693;i√°d and Borsad as a
private estate and to act as the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s deputy
at Baroda. Rangoji was to live at Umreth when not on active service.
Gang√°dhar and Krishn√°ji were censured and forbidden to
engage in any independent alliances with the Muhammadan leaders.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1746.</span>After this D√°m√°ji
sent a general named K√°noji T√°kpar to collect the Sorath
tribute whilst he himself retired to Songad.</p>
<p>Rangoji returned to Ahmed√°b√°d, and not long after
began to quarrel with the viceroy about the Mar√°tha share in the
revenue of the city ceded in 1728.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The G√°ikw√°r in Surat,
1747.</span>In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1747 Ked√°rji
G√°ikw√°r, cousin of D√°m√°ji, was asked by
Syed Achchan, an aspirant to the governorship of Surat, to assist him
in maintaining possession of that city. Before Ked√°rji could
reach Surat the disputes as to the succession had been settled by
negotiations, and the aid of Mar√°tha troops was no longer
required. Ked√°rji, however, finding himself in a position to
dictate terms, demanded three l√°khs of rupees for the aid that
he was prepared to give, and as the Surat treasury could not afford to
pay this sum in cash, one-third of the revenues of Surat was promised
to the G√°ikw√°r.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1748.</span>Rangoji meanwhile attacked
Harib√°, an adopted son of Khander√°v
G√°ikw√°r, and recovered from him the town and fort of
Borsad, which had been seized during the time that Rangoji had been
occupied with his disputes in Ahmed√°b√°d. Khander√°v
and D√°m√°ji both turned against him and captured the fort
after a long siege. Rangoji was then again imprisoned, and not released
until the next year when the Peshwa sent a body of troops into
Gujar√°t. In 1748 Um√°b√°i, widow of
Trimbakr√°v D√°bh√°de, died, leaving one
B√°bur√°v guardian of Yeshv√°ntr√°v her son.
Partly through the solicitations of Khander√°v, who had private
influence with the D√°bh√°des, partly from the fact of
previous possession, D√°m√°ji was confirmed as deputy of
the Mar√°th√°s in Gujar√°t. He there began to collect
an army as quickly as possible, in order to co-operate with
Raghun√°th Bhonsl&eacute; against the Peshwa, in answer to an
appeal by Sakv√°rb√°i, widow of Sh√°hu, to support
the throne against the ministers, and to secure the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> succession of
Sambh√°ji to the S√°t√°ra kingdom. The Peshwa, aware
of D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s ill-will towards himself, did his best
to foment disturbances in Gujar√°t and to extend his own
influence there so as to keep D√°m√°ji away from the
Dakhan.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1750.</span>The Peshwa accordingly entered
into some negotiations with Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, then in
power at Ahmed√°b√°d, but was unable to lend substantial
aid in Gujar√°t against D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s agents, as
the whole Mar√°tha power was required in the Dakhan to operate
against the son of the late Niz√°m-ul-Mulk.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r
Arrested, 1751.</span>Next year D√°m√°ji, at the request of
T√°r√°b√°i, guardian of R√°m R√°ja,
ascended the Salpi gh√°t with a strong force, defeated the
Peshwa&rsquo;s army, and advanced as far as S√°t√°ra. From
this position he was forced to retire, and whilst in treaty with the
Peshwa was treacherously seized by the latter and put into prison.
B√°l√°ji at once demanded arrears of tribute, but
D√°m√°ji declined to agree to any payment, on the ground
that he was no independent chief but only the agent of the
Sen√°pati. He therefore refused to bind his principal or himself
on account of what was due from his principal. B√°l√°ji
then imprisoned all the members of the G√°ikw√°r and
D√°bh√°de family that were at that time in the Dakhan.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Peshwa and Surat.</span>The state of
Surat was at this time such as to afford a good opportunity to the
Peshwa to obtain a footing there independently of the English or of
D√°m√°ji. He had recently had dealings with the former in
the expeditions against &Aacute;ngria of Kol√°ba, and as the
merchants had found him one of the most stable and powerful rulers of
the country, they were willing to treat with him for the future
security of their buildings and goods in Surat. Taking advantage of
D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s confinement, B√°l√°ji sent
<span class="corr" id="xd25e34952" title="Source: Ragun√°thr√°v">Raghun√°thr√°v</span>
to Gujar√°t. This leader, afterwards so well known as
R√°ghoba, took possession of a few <i>t√°lukas</i> in the
north-east of the province, but was recalled to the Dakhan before he
could approach Surat. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n also took advantage
of D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s absence to make an expedition into
Sorath and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a where the
G√°ikw√°r family had now established themselves
permanently.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Release of D√°m√°ji,
1752.</span>The news of these two expeditions made D√°m√°ji
very eager to return to his province; and as he had full information as
to B√°l√°ji&rsquo;s plans with regard to Gujar√°t, he
bribed freely, and in order to regain his liberty consented to much
harsher terms than he would otherwise have done. He agreed to maintain
an army for defence and collection purposes in Gujar√°t, as well
as to furnish a contingent to the Peshwa&rsquo;s army in the Dakhan,
and to contribute towards the support of the R√°ja, now in
reality a state-prisoner dependent upon the wishes of his minister. The
G√°ikw√°r was also to furnish the tribute due on account of
the D√°bh√°de family, whom the Peshwa was apparently trying
to oust from the administration altogether. After deducting the
necessary expenses of collection and defence, half the surplus revenue
was to be handed over to the Peshwa. Even after acceding to all these
proposals, the G√°ikw√°r was not at once released. The
Peshwa protracted the negotiations, as he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> to contend against a
factious court party in whose counsels he knew D√°m√°ji
would play a leading part when once set at liberty. At last, however,
after agreeing to a final request that he would assist
Raghun√°thr√°v against Surat, D√°m√°ji was
allowed to go. There was at this time one P√°ndurang Pant levying
tribute on behalf of the Peshwa in Cambay and Ahmed√°b√°d.
The Naw√°b of Cambay, not having any reason to like or trust his
neighbour the G√°ikw√°r, had persuaded the Peshwa at the
time the partition of the Mar√°tha rights over Gujar√°t was
being settled at Poona, to take Cambay into his share of the province.
The Naw√°b bought off the agent of his ally with a present of
guns and cash. The ruler of Ahmed√°b√°d also came to terms
with the Mar√°th√°s, so P√°ndurang was at liberty to
go and see if he could find equal good fortune in Sorath.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Capture of Ahmed√°b√°d,
1753.</span>D√°m√°ji now came back with a fresh army, which
was soon reinforced by Raghun√°thr√°v. They marched towards
Ahmed√°b√°d, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was too late
to intercept them before they invested the capital. He managed,
however, by a bold movement to enter the town, but after a long siege
was obliged to capitulate and march out with the honours of war. The
Mar√°th√°s conferred on him an estate in the north-west of
Gujar√°t, which, however, was recovered by them some time
afterwards.</p>
<p>After taking possession of Ahmed√°b√°d in April 1753,
Raghun√°thr√°v went to Sorath, and on his return extorted a
large sum as tribute from the Naw√°b of Cambay. He left a deputy
in Ahmed√°b√°d, <span class="marginnote">1754.</span>who
marched against the same chief again in 1754, but on this occasion he
could levy no tribute. As the Naw√°b had firmly established
himself and considerably enlarged his dominions, the Peshwa&rsquo;s
deputy marched against him in person a second time, but was defeated
and taken prisoner. The nominee of Raghun√°thr√°v procured
his release, and the Peshwa&rsquo;s deputy continued to demand
<span class="marginnote">1755.</span>arrears of tribute for his master
till he obtained an agreement to pay at a future date. He then retired
to the Dakhan, and the Naw√°b, taking advantage of the lull to
strengthen his army, captured Ahmed√°b√°d from the
Mar√°tha garrison and established himself in the city. After a
while D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r,
with an agent sent direct by the Peshwa, arrived before the town and
commenced a siege. <span class="marginnote">1757.</span>It was not
until April 1757 that the Mar√°th√°s again entered the
city. The Naw√°b surrendered after the Mar√°th√°s had
fully ratified the conditions he himself had proposed.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1758.</span>Say√°jir√°v, son of
D√°m√°ji, remained in Ahmed√°b√°d on behalf of
his father, and the Peshwa&rsquo;s agent Sad√°shiv put in a
deputy in his turn and went himself to Surat. Here he was soon joined
by Say√°ji, who had to arrange the shares of the tribute in
accordance with the partition treaty of 1751. Next year a body of
Mar√°tha troops was sent to the aid of the R√°v of Kachh,
who was engaged in an expedition against Thatta in Sindh.
Sad√°shiv lent the Naw√°b of Cambay some money on the part
of the Peshwa to enable him to liquidate the arrears of pay due to his
army, but a year afterwards the Mar√°tha army appeared at the
town gates with a demand for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> two years&rsquo; arrears
of tribute in full, amounting to <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr>
20,000. The Naw√°b managed to raise this sum, and the
Mar√°th√°s moved south. D√°m√°ji was at this
time in Poona.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1759.</span>The Peshwa had supported Syed
Achchan of Surat with the view of putting him under an obligation so as
to secure some future advantages, and this year lent him some troops as
a bodyguard. The Naw√°b of Cambay, who was also indebted to the
ministerial party, left his dominions to pay a visit to the Peshwa at
Poona. Khander√°v meanwhile plundered
Lun√°v√°&#7693;a and &Iacute;dar, whilst
Say√°jir√°v was similarly engaged in Sor√°th.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1761.</span>D√°m√°ji
G√°ikw√°r accompanied the Peshwa to Delhi, and was one of
the few Mar√°tha leaders that escaped after the defeat at
P√°nipat. On his return to Gujar√°t he successfully opposed
an expedition by the Naw√°b of Cambay against
B√°l√°sinor and re-took the estates of Jaw√°n Mard
Kh√°n. He also strengthened his position in Sorath and
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35019" title="Source: K√°thi√°va&#7693;a">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>
against the Peshwa&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1761.</span>The Peshwa, being hard pressed
by his rival the Niz√°m, began in this year to make overtures to
the East India Company&rsquo;s officers in Bombay, with a view to
getting the aid of European artillery and gunners. He at first offered
to give up a valuable tract of land in <span class="corr" id="xd25e35026" title="Source: J√°mbusar">Jambusar</span>. But the
English would accept no territory but the island of S√°lsette,
the town of Bassein, and the small islands in the harbour of Bombay.
These the Mar√°tha government declined to give up, so
negotiations were broken off.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1762.</span>Next year
Raghun√°thr√°v, as guardian of the son of
B√°l√°ji, named M√°dhavr√°v, who was still a
minor, conferred the title of Sen√°pati on one of the
J√°dhav family who had formerly borne it. The administration of
Gujar√°t, however, which had always accompanied the title when
held by the D√°bh√°de family, was left practically in the
hands of D√°m√°ji, and no mention of any transfer of it was
made at the time J√°dhav was appointed commander-in-chief.
Discontented with the empty honour thus conferred, R√°mchandra,
the new Sen√°pati, joined the Niz√°m&rsquo;s party, and on
account of this defection the Peshwa, two years afterwards, cancelled
the appointment and restored the office to the Ghorpade family, one of
whose members had held it long before. This put an end to the
connection of Gujar√°t with the chief military dignity of the
Mar√°tha state.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Intrigues of R√°ghoba,
1768.</span>After M√°dhavr√°v B√°l√°ji came of
age he had constantly to be on this guard against the plots of his
uncle Raghun√°thr√°v, who had refused to accept the share
in the government offered him by the young Peshwa.
Raghun√°thr√°v, perhaps instigated by his wife, had no
doubt great hopes of obtaining a share in the whole power of the
administration, and suspecting M√°dhavr√°v to be aware of
his designs, looked upon all the overtures made by the latter as
intended in some way or other to entrap him. He therefore collected an
army of some 15,000 men in B√°gl√°n and N√°sik, and
hoping to be joined on his way by J√°noji Bhonsl&eacute;,
advanced towards Poona. In his army was Govindr√°v, son of
D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, with a detachment of his
father&rsquo;s troops. The Peshwa, without giving J√°noji time to
effect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> a junction with
Raghun√°thr√°v, even if he had been prepared to do so,
defeated his uncle&rsquo;s army at Dhorap, a fort in the Ajunta range,
and carried off R√°ghob√° and Govindr√°v to Poona,
where they were placed in confinement.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Death of D√°m√°ji
G√°ikw√°r, 1768.</span>Not long after this action
D√°m√°ji died. He had brought the fortunes of the
G√°ikw√°r house to the highest pitch they ever reached and
not long after his death the family influence began to decline. It was
his personal authority alone that was able to counteract the usual
tendency of quasi-independent Mar√°tha states towards
disintegration, especially when they are at a distance from the central
power. Khander√°v and Say√°jir√°v had shown frequent
signs of insubordination (as for instance in their espousal of the
cause of Rangoji) and a desire to establish themselves in an
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35054" title="Source: independant">independent</span> position, but the sagacity of
D√°m√°ji foresaw the advantage such a partition would give
an enemy like the Peshwa, and his tact enabled him to preserve unity in
his family, at least in resistance to what he showed them to be their
common foe.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disputed Succession.</span>The quarrel for
the succession that arose on <span class="corr" id="xd25e35061" title="Source: D√°m√°j&rsquo;s">D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s</span>
death was the first step towards the breaking up of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s power. D√°m√°ji had three
wives. By the first he had Govindr√°v, who however was born after
Say√°jir√°v, the son by the second wife. His sons by the
third wife were M√°n√°ji and Fatesingh. Govindr√°v
was in confinement at Poona near the court, and therefore in a position
to offer conditions for the confirmation of his rights without loss of
time.</p>
<p>In the Hindu law current amongst Mar√°th√°s, there are
to be found precedents in favour of the heirship of either
Govindr√°v or Say√°jir√°v. Some authorities support
the rights of the son of the first wife whether he be the eldest or
not, others again regard simply the age of the claimants, deciding in
favour of the first born, of whatever wife he may be the son.
R√°mr√°v Sh√°stri, the celebrated adviser of
M√°dhavr√°v Peshwa, is said to have expressed an opinion in
favour of the rights of Say√°jir√°v. Govindr√°v,
however, was on the spot where his influence could be used most
extensively. Say√°ji, moreover, was an idiot and a puppet in the
hands of his half brother Fatesingh. Govindr√°v applied at once
for investiture with the title of <span class="corr" id="xd25e35066"
title="Source: Sen√°-Khas-Khel">Sen√°-Kh√°s-Khel</span>. A
payment of 50&frac12; l√°khs of rupees to the Peshwa on account
of arrears of tribute and a fine for his conduct in taking part with
R√°ghob√° was a strong argument in his favour, and when he
agreed to a tribute previously demanded from his father of <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 7,79,000 yearly and to maintain a peace contingent
at Poona of 3000 horse, to be increased by a thousand more in time of
war, there could be little doubt as to the legitimacy of his claim, and
he was duly invested with his father&rsquo;s title and estate.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1771.</span>For reasons not apparent
Say√°ji&rsquo;s claims were not brought forward till nearly two
years later. Govindr√°v had never been allowed to join his charge
in Gujar√°t, so that he could exercise no interference in that
direction, and the court affairs in the Dakhan left perhaps little time
for the disposal of Say√°jir√°v&rsquo;s application, even
if it had been made. Say√°ji had entrusted his interests to
Fatesingh, a man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401"
name="pb401">401</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> of considerable ability,
who came at once to Poona to get a reversal of the recognition of
Govindr√°v. The Peshwa was glad to have this opportunity of
undoing so much of D√°m√°ji&rsquo;s work and dividing the
G√°ikw√°r family against itself, so using the verdict of
R√°m Sh√°stri as his weapon, he cancelled the former grant
in favour of Govindr√°v, and appointed Say√°jir√°v
with Fatesingh as his <i>mut√°lik</i> or deputy. The latter, by
agreeing to pay an extra sum of 6&frac12; l√°khs of rupees
annually, got permission to retain the Poona contingent of
G√°ikw√°r horse in Gujar√°t, on the pretext that
Govindr√°v would probably attack his brothers on the earliest
opportunity. Thus, whatever happened, all went to the profit of the
Peshwa&rsquo;s party and to the injury of the tax-paying Gujar√°t
ryot.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1773.</span>Fatesingh retired in triumph to
Baroda, and opened negotiations with the English in Surat, as he had
been endeavouring to do for a year past without success. In January
1773, however, he succeeded in getting an agreement from the Chief for
Affairs of the British Nation in Surat, that his share in the revenues
of the town of Broach, which had been taken by storm in 1772 by the
English, should not be affected by the change of masters. In the same
year N√°r√°yanr√°v Peshwa was murdered, and
R√°ghob√° was invested by the titular king at <span class="corr" id="xd25e35097" title="Source: S√°tara">S√°t√°ra</span> with the
ministerial robe of honour. Govindr√°v G√°ikw√°r,
still in Poona, reminded the new Peshwa of the good offices of the
G√°ikw√°r family at Dhorap and elsewhere, and found means
of getting reinstated as Sen√°-Kh√°s-Khel. In 1774 he set
out for Gujar√°t, and collecting a fair number of adherents on
his way, he attacked Fatesingh. <span class="marginnote">1774.</span>After various engagements of little
importance, the latter found himself shut into the city of Baroda,
which was invested by Govindr√°v in January 1775.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° Peshwa,
1774.</span>In the meantime R√°ghob√° had been driven from
power by the intrigues of Br√°hmans of a different class from
that to which he belonged, headed by the afterwards well-known
N√°na Phadnis. The ex-Peshwa first betook himself towards
M√°lwa, where he hoped to be joined or at least assisted by
Holkar and Sindia. As soon however as he got together some scattered
forces he marched down the T√°pti and opened negotiations with
the English through Mr. Gambier, the chief at Surat. The Bombay
Government at once demanded the cession of Bassein, S√°lsette,
and the adjacent islands. R√°ghob√° refused, partly, in all
probability, on account of the pride felt by the Mar√°tha
soldiery in their achievements before Bassein at the time of the great
siege. He however offered valuable territory in Gujar√°t,
yielding a revenue of about eleven l√°khs, and to pay six
l√°khs down and 1&frac12; l√°khs monthly for the
maintenance of a European contingent with artillery. The English at
Bombay were debating whether this offer should not be accepted when
news reached them that the Portuguese were about to organise an
expedition to re-take Bassein. Negotiations with R√°ghob√°
were hastily broken off and a small force sent to forestall the rival
Europeans. Before the end of 1774, both Th√°na and Versova fort
in S√°lsette had been taken.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° in Gujar√°t,
1775.</span>R√°ghob√° now heard that Sindia and Holkar had
been bought over by the ministerial party and would not come to his
assistance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> Quickly moving his force
down the river he reached Baroda in January 1775 with 10,000 horse and
400 foot. He joined Govindr√°v in investing that town, but sent
meanwhile an agent to re-open the discussion of his proposals in the
Bombay Council. This agent was captured by a party of Fatesingh&rsquo;s
horse whilst he was out on an expedition near P√°rnera on behalf
of Govindr√°v. On his release he repaired to Surat and took steps
to get a treaty of alliance signed as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° Defeated.</span>The
ministerial army of 30,000 men under Haripant Phadke entered
Gujar√°t and obliged Govindr√°v and R√°ghob√°
to raise the siege of Baroda and to retire towards the Mahi.
Fatesingh&rsquo;s force then joined Haripant. An attack on all sides
was made (Feb. 17th). R√°ghob√°, who was in the centre, was
first charged, and before Govindr√°v and Khander√°v
G√°ikw√°r could come to his assistance his best officers
were wounded, some of his Arab mercenaries refused to fight as large
arrears of pay were due to them, and he was defeated on both flanks. He
fled to Cambay with only 1000 horse; whilst the two
G√°ikw√°rs and Man√°ji Sindia (Phadke) led the rest
of the scattered army to Kapadvanj, where it was again set in order.
The Naw√°b of Cambay, fearing lest the Mar√°tha army should
come in pursuit, shut the town gates on the fugitive and refused to
give him shelter. <span class="marginnote">Reaches Surat.</span>Mr.
Malet, chief of the English residents, who had been informed of the
negotiations in progress between his Government and
R√°ghob√°, contrived to get the ex-Peshwa conveyed
privately to Bh√°vnagar and from thence by boat to Surat. Here he
arrived on February 23rd.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty of Surat, 1775.</span>The
stipulations of the treaty negotiated by Narotamd√°s, agent of
R√°ghob√°, and the Bombay Government were: The English to
provide a force of 3000 men, of which 800 were to be Europeans and 1700
natives, together with a due proportion of artillery. In return for
this R√°ghob√°, still recognized as Peshwa, was to cede in
perpetuity S√°lsette, Bassein and the islands, <span class="corr"
id="xd25e35135" title="Source: J√°mbusar">Jambusar</span>, and
Olp√°d. He also made over an assignment of <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 75,000 out of the revenues of Anklesvar, the
remaining portion of which district, together with &Aacute;mod,
H√°nsot, and Bals√°r was placed under British management as
security for the monthly contribution of 1&frac12; l√°khs for the
support of the troops in his service. He also promised to procure the
cession of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share in the revenues of
Broach. Sundry other provisions (dealing with different parts of the
Mar√°tha dominions) were inserted, R√°ghob√° being
treated throughout as the representative of the Mar√°tha kingdom.
This treaty was signed on March 6th, 1775, at Surat, but on the
previous day there had been a debate in the Council at Bombay as to the
propriety of continuing to support R√°ghob√°, as the news
from Gujar√°t made the British authorities doubtful whether the
contingent they had already sent to Surat was enough to ensure
success.</p>

Gujar√°t.</span>Just before the treaty was drawn up, at the end
of February Lieut.-Colonel Keating had been despatched in command of
350 European infantry 800 sepoys 80 European artillerymen and 60 gun
lascars with others, in all about 1500 men, ready for active service.
This force landed at Surat four days after R√°ghob√° had
arrived from Bh√°vnagar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403"

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> Before receiving this
token of the intention of the British to support R√°ghob√°,
the Naw√°b had treated the latter simply as a fugitive, but upon
finding that the Bombay Government had determined to make the ex-Peshwa
their ally, he paid the customary visits and offered presents as to a
superior.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Keating Sails with R√°ghob√°
for Cambay.</span>When the news reached Surat that
Govindr√°v&rsquo;s troops and the rest had been reorganized at
Kapadvanj, it was determined to effect a junction with them by landing
Colonel Keating&rsquo;s detachment at Cambay and from thence marching
north.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° in Cambay,
1775.</span>Considerable delay occurred in carrying out the first part
of this proposal. First of all R√°ghob√° detained the army
at Dumas<a class="noteref" id="n403.1src" href="#n403.1" name="n403.1src">12</a> whilst he paid a visit of ceremony to the frequented
temple of Bhimpor in the neighbourhood. Then again, the convoy met with
contrary winds the whole way up the gulf, and it was not till March
17th that the contingent landed. The Naw√°b, accompanied by the
British Resident, paid a visit of ceremony and presented
<i>nazar√°n√°s</i> to R√°ghob√° as a sort of
atonement for his previous discourtesy and neglect. The
Mar√°th√°s, however, knowing that this change of tone was
entirely due to the presence and alliance of the Europeans, paid much
more attention to the latter than to the Muhammadans.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Govindr√°v
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s Army.</span>The British contingent
encamped at a place called N√°r√°yan-Sarovar, just north of
the town. Here they waited until the reinforcement from Bombay arrived,
bringing the whole force up to the complement stipulated for in the
treaty. R√°ghob√°&rsquo;s army under Govindr√°v
G√°ikw√°r was reported to be moving southwards, and Colonel
Keating agreed to let it pass the S√°barmati river before joining
it. Meanwhile the enemy, said to number 40,000 infantry and 12,000
cavalry, marched north to intercept Govindr√°v. The latter,
however, by forced marches succeeded in crossing the S√°barmati
before the arrival of the ministerial army, and encamped a few miles
north-east of Cambay at a place called Darmaj or Dara. Here Colonel
Keating joined him about the middle of April.</p>
<p>Govindr√°v&rsquo;s army consisted of about 8000 fighting men
and nearly 18,000 camp followers. These latter were chiefly
Pindh√°ris who used to attach themselves to the camp of one of
the Mar√°tha chiefs, on condition of surrendering to him half
their plunder. Each chief had his separate encampment, where he
exercised independent authority over his own troops, although bound to
general obedience to the commander-in-chief of the whole army. The
confusion of this arrangement is described by an eye-witness as utterly
destructive of all military discipline. To add to the cumbrousness of
such an expedition, most of the Pindh√°ris brought their wives
and children with them, the cooking pots and plunder being carried on
bullocks and ponies, of which there were altogether nearly 200,000
attached to the troops. In every camp there was a regular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> <i>baz√°r</i> where
cash payment or barter passed equally current, so that a premium was
thus placed on the pilfering of small articles by the Pindh√°ris,
whose stipulations as to plunder were confined neither to friend nor
enemy.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Advance of the Combined Forces.</span>When
all needful preparations had been made, the army, accompanied by a
battery of ten guns, besides mortars and howitzers, all of which were
manned by Europeans, moved out against the enemy. The latter slowly
retreated, burning the crops and forage and destroying the water-supply
on its way. On the 20th April the first engagement took place at
Us√°mli, resulting in the repulse of the ministerial troops. On
May 1st a similar skirmish on the banks of the V√°trak drove the
ministerialists into Kaira. From this post they were driven after a
series of slight engagements with the army of R√°ghob√°,
which crossed the river at M√°tar. Fatesingh now received a
reinforcement of 10,000 horse under Khander√°v
G√°ikw√°r, but to counterbalance this aid, Sindia and
Holkar from some unexplained cause, connected probably with intrigues
at Poona, withdrew from further co-operation with him. Colonel Keating
was unable to follow up the advantages he had gained owing to the large
proportion of cavalry in the enemy&rsquo;s army. He therefore continued
his march southwards, after persuading R√°ghoba to spend the
monsoon in Poona, where he would be on the spot to counteract
intrigues, instead of at Ahmed√°b√°d, as had been at first
proposed.</p>
<p>On May 8th the army reached Na&#7693;i√°d, after repulsing on
the road two attacks by the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry. This result was
obtained chiefly by means of the European light artillery.
Na&#7693;i√°d belonged at this time to Khander√°v
G√°ikw√°r, and to punish his defection to Fatesingh,
R√°ghob√° inflicted a fine of 60,000 rupees on the town.
The amount was assessed on the several castes in proportion to their
reputed means of payment. The Bh√°ts, a peculiar people of whom
more hereafter, objected to being assessed, and slaughtered each other
in public: so that the guilt of their blood might fall on the
oppressor. The Br√°hmans, who also claimed exemption from all
taxation, more astutely brought two old women of their caste into the
market place and there murdered them. Having made this protest, both
castes paid their contributions. R√°ghob√° injudiciously
wasted seven days over the collection of this fine, and in the end only
levied 40,000 rupees.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Defeat of Fatesingh, 1775.</span>On May
14th the march was resumed, under the usual skirmishing onslaughts of
the ministerial party. At Ar√°s, where R√°ghob√° had
been defeated shortly before, he was in imminent danger of a second and
still more serious discomfiture. An order mistaken by a British
company, and the want of discipline on the part of
R√°ghob√°&rsquo;s cavalry nearly led to a total defeat with
great slaughter. The European infantry and artillery, however, turned
the fortunes of the day. The troops of Fatesingh were allowed to
approach in pursuit to within a few yards of the batteries, all the
guns of which then opened on them with grape, the infantry meanwhile
plying their small arms along the whole line. Fatesingh was obliged to
withdraw his diminished forces and the army of R√°ghob√°
received no further molestations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405"

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> from him on its way to
the Mahi. Colonel Keating then ordered a general move to Broach, where
he arrived safely on 27th May, after a troublesome march through the
robber-infested country between the Dh√°dhar river and
&Aacute;mod.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Ministerial General
Retreats.</span>Here they remained until June 8th, when Colonel Keating
was about to move south again. Luckily, as it turned out for him, the
nearest ford was impassable and he had to march to one higher up at a
place variously called B√°ba Pi√°ra or B√°va Pir. On
his way thither he heard that Haripant, the ministerial
commander-in-chief, was halting on the north bank by the ford; he
therefore pushed on to make an attack on the rear, but owing partly to
timely information received and partly to the confusion caused by the
irrepressibility of R√°ghob√°&rsquo;s cavalry, Haripant had
time to withdraw all his force except some <span class="corr" id="xd25e35221" title="Source: bagage">baggage</span> and ammunition,
which, with a few guns, he was forced in the hurry of his passage
across the river to leave behind. <span class="marginnote">Colonel
Keating at Dabhoi, 1775.</span>Colonel Keating then marched fourteen
miles north from the ford and halted before proceeding to Dabhoi, a
town belonging to Fatesingh. The general ignorance of tactics and want
of discipline in the native army had determined Colonel Keating not to
lead his force as far as Poona, but to spend the monsoon near
Baroda.</p>
<p>R√°ghob√° detached one of his generals, Amir
Kh√°n, in pursuit of Ganeshpant, whom Hari Pant had left as his
deputy in Gujar√°t. Ganeshpant with a detachment of the
ministerial army had separated from Hari at the B√°ba
Pi√°ra ford and found his way through the wild country on the
north of the T√°pti towards Ahmed√°b√°d. He was
finally caught by Amir Kh√°n.</p>
<p>Dabhoi was at this time in charge of a Br√°hman governor, who
submitted on the approach of R√°ghob√°&rsquo;s army.
Colonel Keating quartered his force in the town, but
R√°ghob√°, after exacting a levy of three l√°khs of
rupees, encamped at Bhil√°pur on the Dh√°dhar, ten miles
from Dabhoi. Here he began to negotiate with Fatesingh in Baroda
through the mediation of Colonel Keating. Fatesingh was all the more
ready to come to definite terms of agreement, as he knew that
Govindr√°v was on the watch to recover Baroda.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° and the
G√°ikw√°rs.</span>It is not certain what the terms proposed
and agreed to really were. The only record of them is a copy sent in
1802 to the Resident at Poona by Governor Duncan. According to this
document Govindr√°v was to lose his pension and to occupy the
same position as before the accession of R√°ghob√°.
Khander√°v was to revert to the situation in which he had been
placed by D√°m√°ji. The provision of the treaty of the 6th
March regarding the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s claims on Broach was
ratified, and as a reward for the mediation of the Bombay Government,
the G√°ikw√°r ceded to the British in perpetuity the
sub-divisions of Chikhli and Vari√°v near Surat and Koral on the
Narbada. Before this treaty could be concluded, Colonel Keating
received orders to withdraw his contingent into British territory and
to leave R√°ghob√° to manage for himself. This change of
policy was due to the disapproval by the Supreme Government of the
treaty of 6th March, which they alleged had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> made inconsistently with
the negotiations then being carried on with the ruling powers at Poona
as well as with the authority of the Calcutta Government. The treaty
was therefore declared to be invalid and the troops in the field were
ordered by the Supreme Government to be withdrawn at once into British
garrisons. A special envoy, Colonel Upton, was sent from Bengal to
negotiate a treaty with the Ministers in accordance with the views
current in Calcutta.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Withdrawal of the British
Contingent.</span>As soon as the roads were open Colonel Keating moved
towards Surat, but at the solicitation of R√°ghob√° he
disobeyed his orders so far as to encamp at Kadod, about twenty miles
east of Surat, but not in British territory. Here he awaited the
results of the overtures of Colonel Upton. This envoy remained at Poona
from the 28th December 1775 till the 1st March 1776, on which date
<span class="marginnote">Negotiations at Poona.</span>he signed the
treaty of Purandhar, in which the office only and not the name of the
Peshwa is mentioned. By this compact the Peshwa ceded all claims on the
revenue of Broach together with land in the neighbourhood of that town
to the British. He also paid twelve l√°khs of rupees in
compensation for the expenses of the war. S√°lsette was to be
either retained by the English or restored in exchange for territory
yielding three l√°khs of rupees annually. The cessions made by
Fatesingh G√°ikw√°r were to be restored to him if the
Peshwa&rsquo;s Government could prove that he had no right to make them
without due authorization from Poona. The treaty of the 6th March was
declared null and void. R√°ghob√° was to disband his army
and take a pension. If he resisted, the English were to give him no
assistance. If he agreed to the terms proposed, he was to live at
Kopargaon<a class="noteref" id="n406.1src" href="#n406.1" name="n406.1src">13</a> on the God√°vari with an ample pension. When
he received information as to the terms of the new treaty, he at once
declined to accept the pension, and, as he could not understand the
position of the Bombay Government with regard to that at Calcutta, he
proceeded to offer still more favourable terms for further
assistance.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° at Surat,
1776.</span>R√°ghob√° was at M√°ndvi<a class="noteref" id="n406.2src" href="#n406.2" name="n406.2src">14</a> on the
T√°pti when he was finally given to understand that the British
could no longer aid him. He thereupon took refuge in Surat with two
hundred followers. The rest of his army which had been ordered to
disperse, gathered round Surat, on pretence of waiting for the payment
of the arrears due to them. As their attitude was suspicious, and there
were rumours of an expedition having started from Poona under Haripant
to subdue them, the Bombay Government garrisoned Surat and Broach with
all the forces it could spare.</p>
<p>Colonel Upton meanwhile offered R√°ghob√°, on behalf of
the ministers, a larger pension with liberty of residing at
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35270" title="Source: Ben√°res">Benares</span>. This also was declined, and
the ex-Peshwa fled to Bombay, where he lived on a monthly pension
allotted him by the Government. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407"

<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> On 20th August 1776, a
despatch of the Court of Directors arrived confirming the treaty of the
6th March 1775. At first the Bombay Government were inclined to take
this as authorizing the retention of all the territory ceded, but on
further deliberation it was decided that as the treaty of Purandhar had
been ratified by the Supreme Government subsequent to the signing of
the despatch, which was dated 5th April 1776, it was evident that the
Court of Directors did not mean to uphold the previous engagement more
than temporarily, or until the final treaty had been concluded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Negotiations at Poona, 1777.</span>At the
end of 1776, a Bombay officer was sent in place of Colonel Upton to be
a resident envoy at Poona for the carrying out of the provisions of the
treaty. Mr. Mostyn was the person selected, and he arrived in Poona in
March 1777. He soon found that the ministers had little intention of
adhering to the treaty, so he at once took up the question that he
thought it most important to the Bombay Government to have settled,
namely the relations of the Peshwa&rsquo;s Court with Fatesingh
G√°ikw√°r as regards the cessions of territory. The
ministers asserted that the G√°ikw√°rs merely administered
Gujar√°t on the part of the Peshwa and were entirely dependent
upon the Poona government, so that they could conclude no agreement
with foreign states except with its approbation. Fatesingh did not deny
the dependence, but evaded the question of his right to make direct
treaties and claimed the restitution of the cessions on the ground that
Raghun√°thr√°v had failed to perform his part of the
stipulations. The point was discussed for some time, and at last the
question of dependence seems to have been let drop, for in February
1778 Fatesingh paid up the arrears of tribute, made the usual presents
to the ministers and their favourites, and was again invested with the
title of Sen√°-Kh√°s-Khel.</p>
<p>In October a despatch from the Court of Directors reached the
Governments of Bengal and Bombay, disapproving of the treaty of
Purandhar, but ratifying it on the principle <i>factum valet</i>. It
was suggested, however, that in case of evasion on the part of the
ministers, a fresh treaty should be concluded with
R√°ghob√° on the lines of that of 1775.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Fresh Alliance with R√°ghob√°,
1778.</span>In November 1778 it was rumoured that the ministers in
Poona were intriguing with the French, so the Bombay Government took
this opportunity of entering into a treaty with R√°ghob√°,
who was still in Bombay. He confirmed the grants of 1775, and as
security for the pay of the British contingent that was to help in
placing him on the Peshwa&rsquo;s throne in Poona, he agreed to assign
the revenues of Bals√°r and the remainder of Anklesvar, as he had
done before. He stipulated, however, that his own agents should collect
the dues from these districts, and that the British should take charge
of them only in case of the full sum due not being paid and then merely
as a temporary measure.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Convention of Bhadgaon, 1779.</span>On
the 22nd November 1778 the force moved out of Bombay, and by dint of
mismanagement and internal dissension the campaign was brought to an
end by the convention of the 16th January 1779. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> Under this agreement all
possessions in Gujar√°t acquired since the time of
M√°dhavr√°v Peshwa were to be restored by the British,
together with S√°lsette, Uran, and other islands.
R√°ghob√° was to be made over to Sindia&rsquo;s charge, and
a separate treaty assigned to Sindia the sovereignty of Broach.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Negotiation with the
G√°ikw√°r.</span>The Council at Bombay disavowed the
convention and were inclined to adhere only to the clause allotting
Broach to Sindia. Mr. Hornby proposed to the Supreme Government an
alliance with Fatesingh, engaging to free him from dependence on the
Poona Government and to reconcile the disputants within the
G√°ikw√°r family itself. After the arrival of General
Goddard with reinforcements from Bengal the Governor General approved
of the alliance proposed with Fatesingh as head of the Baroda state,
but specially declined to admit any participation or support in the
family disputes. The British were to conquer for themselves the
Peshwa&rsquo;s share of Gujar√°t, if they were able to do so.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°ghob√° Escapes from Sindia,
1779.</span>R√°ghob√°, meanwhile, who had been given over
to Sindia to be conveyed to Bundelkhand, escaped with the connivance of
his custodian and fled to Broach. This was evidently a move calculated
by Sindia to bring on hostilities between N√°na Phadnis, the head
of the ministerial party, and the English. General Goddard, who was
conducting the negotiations with Poona on the part both of the Supreme
Government and of the Government of Bombay, received
R√°ghob√° on June 12th, but evaded any proposals for a
direct alliance. At the end of the rains of the same year, information
was received by the English that a coalition against them had been
<span class="marginnote">League against the English, 1780.</span>formed
by the Mar√°th√°s, the Niz√°m, and Hyder Ali of
Mysor. The rumour was partially confirmed by the demand by N√°na
Phadnis for the cession of S√°lsette and the person of
R√°ghob√° as preliminaries to any treaty. No answer was
given, but reinforcements were called for and the overtures with
Fatesingh pushed forward. This chief prevaricated about the terms of
the treaty and evidently did not like to enter into any special
engagement that might perhaps bring down upon him the Poona army.
General Goddard therefore advanced on 1st January 1780 against Dabhoi,
which was garrisoned by the Peshwa&rsquo;s troops from the Dakhan,
whilst the English in Broach expelled the Mar√°tha officers from
their posts and re-took possession of Anklesvar, H√°nsot, and
&Aacute;mod. On January 20th Dabhoi was evacuated by the
Mar√°th√°s and occupied by General Goddard. Fatesingh now
showed himself willing to enter into the proposed treaty, and on the
26th January 1780 signed an offensive and defensive alliance.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty with Fatesingh
G√°ikw√°r.</span>In the re-opening of hostilities there was
no mention of R√°ghob√°, but the ground given was simply
the non-fulfilment on the part of the Peshwa of his treaty engagement.
R√°ghob√° remained under English supervision in the
enjoyment of a large allowance. Dabhoi was occupied by an English civil
officer with a detachment of irregulars, and General Goddard moved
towards Ahmed√°b√°d. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409"

<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> By the treaty of 1780 the
Peshwa was to be excluded from Gujar√°t. To avoid confusion in
collection, the district north of the Mahi was to belong entirely to
the share of the G√°ikw√°r. The English were to enjoy the
whole district south of the T√°pti, together with the
G√°ikw√°r share in the revenue of Surat. In return for the
support the English were to give him in withholding tribute
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35347" title="Source: fron">from</span> the
Peshwa, <span class="corr" id="xd25e35350" title="Source: Fatesing">Fatesingh</span> ceded Sinor on the Narbada and the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s villages round Broach. These cessions,
however, were not to have effect until Fatesingh was in possession of
Ahmed√°b√°d. The contingent of 3000 horse was to be still
furnished by the G√°ikw√°r government.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">General Goddard takes
Ahmed√°b√°d, 1780.</span>As soon as these conditions were
agreed upon, General Goddard went with his own army and the contingent
furnished by Fatesingh to Ahmed√°b√°d. After encamping
before it for five days, he took the city by storm on 15th February
1780.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Operations against Sindia and
Holkar.</span>Sindia and Holkar had combined their forces against the
English and were marching up Gujar√°t, plundering on their way.
They were opposed by General Goddard, who marched across the Mahi early
in March. The allies turned off towards Ch√°mp√°ner without
risking a pitched battle on the plain. Sindia at once opened
negotiations with the view of wasting time during the fair season. His
first proposal was that R√°ghob√° should be sent to
Jh√°nsi, where Sindia had allotted him an estate, and that
B√°jir√°v, R√°ghob√°&rsquo;s son, should be
appointed <i>div√°n</i> or manager of the Peshwa <span class="corr" id="xd25e35364" title="Source: Madh√°vr√°v">M√°dhavr√°v</span>, who
was a minor. B√°jir√°v himself was under age, so Sindia
was, of course, to assume temporarily the reins of government.</p>
<p>Goddard at once refused to force R√°ghob√° to take any
course other than the one he should select of his own free will; for
Sindia did not appear to be aware that the English were now at war with
the ministers on their own account and not as allies of an ex-Peshwa.
Negotiations were broken off and Sindia and Holkar dislodged from place
after place without any decisive engagement being fought. General
Goddard was preparing monsoon quarters for his army, when he heard that
a division of a Mar√°tha force which had been plundering the
Konkan in order to cut off supplies from Bombay had attacked parts of
the Surat Ath√°visi. He detached some troops under Lieut. Welsh
and sent them to the south, whilst he remained himself on the Narbada.
Lieut. Welsh drove back the marauders and took possession of the forts
of P√°rnera, Indargad, and Bagv√°da.</p>
<p>After the monsoon of 1780, General Goddard went to besiege Bassein,
leaving Major Forbes in charge of the Gujar√°t army. This officer
posted one body of troops at Ahmed√°b√°d for the protection
of Fatesingh, another at Surat, and a third at Broach. Two battalions
of Bengal infantry were sent to Sinor and some few men to Dabhoi.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1781.</span>An attack was made by Sindia on
the newly acquired district of Sinor, but Major Forbes successfully
resisted it and Sindia&rsquo;s position with regard to his own
dominions was now such as to prevent him from sending more expeditions
against Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>The military necessities of other parts of India were such as to
induce General Goddard to apply to Fatesingh for an increase to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> his contingent, in
accordance with the treaty of 1780. After some personal communications
with this Chief in Gujar√°t, General Goddard was able to arrange
with the G√°ikw√°r for the defence of part of that province
and thus set free some European troops for service elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty of S√°lbai, 1782.</span>No
further attack was made in this direction during the continuance of the
war which came to an end on 17th May 1782. The treaty of S√°lbai
between an envoy of the Governor General on one side and
Mah√°d√°ji Sindia as plenipotentiary for the Peshwa and
minister of Poona on the other, replaced the Mar√°tha territory
in Gujar√°t exactly where it was on the outbreak of hostilities
against R√°ghob√° in 1775. It was, however, specially
stipulated that no demand for arrears of tribute during the late
hostilities should be made against the G√°ikw√°r, a clause
that led to misunderstandings many years later. The town of Broach was
given over to Sindia in accordance with the secret negotiation of 1779
and the votes of the Bengal and Bombay Councils. The territory round
Broach yielding a revenue of three l√°khs of rupees, ceded by the
Peshwa, was likewise returned. R√°ghob√° was granted a
pension of 25,000 rupees a month and allowed to select his own place of
residence. He went to Kopargaon and there died a few months after the
conclusion of the treaty of S√°lbai. Thus came to an end one of
the chief sources of disturbance to the Poona government. For the next
six years no event of any political importance took place in
Gujar√°t, which province was left almost entirely to the
administration of the G√°ikw√°r family.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Death of Fatesingh, 1789.</span>In 1789,
however, Fatesingh died, leaving Say√°jir√°v without a
guardian. M√°n√°ji, a younger brother, at once seized the
reins of government and began the usual sort of negotiations to secure
his recognition by the Poona government. He paid a nazar√°na of
3,13,000 rupees and agreed to pay up thirty-six l√°khs of rupees
as arrears, though it is not clear on what account, unless that sum had
accrued since the treaty of S√°lbai, or was part of the long
standing account left open by D√°m√°ji in 1753.
M√°n√°ji, however, was not allowed to succeed to the post
of guardian without opposition. Govindr√°v G√°ikw√°r
was living at Poona, and, though he had himself little influence with
the Peshwa&rsquo;s immediate adherents, he had managed to secure the
then powerful Sindia on his side. This chief, since his recognition as
plenipotentiary at the treaty of S√°lbai, had been gradually
making good his position with the Peshwa and his favourites as well as
with the leading Mar√°tha nobles, so as to be able to
successfully oppose N√°na Phadnis when the time came for a
coalition of the outlying chiefs against the ministerial party.
Govindr√°v offered his son &Aacute;nandr√°v as husband for
the daughter of Sindia, a proposal which it is not probable that he
ever intended to carry out. A grant of three l√°khs of rupees was
also promised, in return for which Sindia allowed his garrison in
Broach to assist Govindr√°v&rsquo;s illegitimate son
K√°nhoji to reach Baroda. M√°n√°ji applied to the
Bombay Government on the grounds that the steps taken by
Govindr√°v were contrary to the provisions of the treaty of 1780.
As however this treaty had been abrogated by the later agreement at
S√°lbai, the Bombay Government declined to interfere.

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> contrived to get
N√°na Phadnis to propose a compromise, to which however
Govindr√°v, at the instigation probably of Sindia, declined to
accede. Before any decision was reached M√°n√°ji died.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1793.</span>N√°na detained
Govindr√°v in Poona till he had agreed to hold by former
stipulations and to cede to the Peshwa the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share in the districts south of the
T√°pti together with his share of the Surat customs. To this the
Government of Bombay demurred as an infraction of the provision of the
S√°lbai treaty whereby the integrity of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s possessions was assured. N√°na
Phadnis at once withdrew his proposals. Govindr√°v at last joined
his brother at Baroda on 19th December, and took up the office of
regent.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&Aacute;ba Shelukar Deputy Governor of
Gujar√°t, 1796.</span>For two years Gujar√°t remained
quiet. In 1796 B√°jir√°v, son of R√°ghob√°,
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35420" title="Source: suceeded">succeeded</span> to the Peshwa&rsquo;s dignity and
at once appointed his younger brother, ten years of age, governor of
Gujar√°t. In accordance with Mar√°tha custom a deputy was
sent to take charge of the province, one &Aacute;ba Shelukar, and he
too seems to have administered vicariously, for next year (1797) we
find him amongst those taken prisoners with N√°na Phadnis when
that minister was treacherously seized by <span class="corr" id="xd25e35423" title="Source: Daulatrav">Daulatr√°v</span> Sindia
in the Dakhan. &Aacute;ba was released on promising to pay ten
l√°khs of rupees as ransom. <span class="marginnote">1797.</span>He then joined his appointment as
subhed√°r in order to take measures to get together the money he
required.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disputes between &Aacute;ba and
Govindr√°v G√°ikw√°r.</span>B√°jir√°v
Peshwa was anxious to embroil &Aacute;ba with Govindr√°v, whom he
knew to be favourable to N√°na Phadnis and too powerful to be
allowed to acquire influence beyond the reach of head-quarter
supervision. A cause of quarrel soon arose. Daulatr√°v pressed
&Aacute;ba for part payment of the above ten l√°khs, and the
latter being unable to squeeze enough out of his own territory, forced
contributions from some of the villages administered by the
G√°ikw√°r. Govindr√°v at once took up arms against
him and applied for aid to the English Agent at Surat. In this city
Governor Jonathan Duncan had just assumed chief authority in accordance
with an agreement between the English and the Naw√°b. Duncan was
anxious to secure for his government the land round Surat and the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s share in the <i>chauth</i> of the town
and district. Govindr√°v, when this demand was made, referred the
Governor to Poona, knowing that under the treaty of S√°lbai the
British Government had no more right to acquire a share of the
G√°ikw√°r territory than the Poona authorities had when
they made a somewhat similar demand in 1793, which was withdrawn as
stated above. Before the reference could be made, &Aacute;ba was penned
up by Govindr√°v&rsquo;s own army in Ahmed√°b√°d and
forced to surrender that city. He was kept in confinement for more than
seven years.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gujar√°t farmed to the
G√°ikw√°r, 1799.</span>In the same year (1799) the Peshwa,
apparently without formally revoking the appointment of his brother
Chimn√°ji as Subhed√°r, gave Govindr√°v a farm for
five years of his whole rights in Gujar√°t, at the rate of five
l√°khs of rupees a year. These rights included shares in the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and Sorath tribute, the revenue
of Petl√°d, N√°p√°d, R√°npur, Dhandhuka, and
Gogha, together with rights to certain customs dues in Cambay and a
share in the revenue of the city of Ahmed√°b√°d.

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> Govindr√°v
unfortunately died a month before this farm was formally made over by
the Peshwa.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">&Aacute;nandr√°v
G√°ikw√°r, 1800.</span>As had happened at the death of
D√°m√°ji, so again now, the heir &Aacute;nandr√°v was
all but an idiot and quite incapable of managing his affairs. The
disputes as to the guardianship again set the whole state in confusion.
K√°nhoji, a son of Govindr√°v by a R√°jputni princess
of Dharampor, who had been the first agent of his father in Baroda in
1793, had been put in prison for refusing to give place to
Govindr√°v when the latter at length joined him at Baroda. At the
death of Govindr√°v, K√°nhoji managed to obtain his liberty
and to secure the ascendancy in the counsels of his weak-minded elder
brother. He assumed, in fact, the whole government. His arrogant
conduct in this new position excited the Arab guard against him and he
was again thrown into confinement. His mother Gajr√°b√°i,
who was a refugee in Surat, endeavoured to get assistance from the
English there, and at the same time made overtures to Malh√°r,
son of Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, who had formerly been
one of Govindr√°v&rsquo;s bitterest opponents.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1800.</span>Meanwhile the administration of
the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s affairs passed into the hands of
R√°vji and B√°b√°ji &Aacute;ppa, two brothers who had
been brought to Baroda in 1793 by Govindr√°v himself.
R√°vji took charge of the civil work, whilst B√°b√°ji
undertook the military duties, which at that time consisted in great
measure in collecting the revenue by show of force. These two
ministers, on hearing of the proceedings of <span class="marginnote">The British aid Govindr√°v&rsquo;s
Party.</span>Gajr√°b√°i, outbid her for the aid of the
Bombay Government. In addition to the cessions formerly offered by
Govindr√°v, they were willing to give up Chikhli also. Matters
were precipitated by the successes of Malh√°r√°v in the
field. R√°vji offered to subsidize five European battalions, and
Governor Duncan took upon himself the responsibility of sending an
auxiliary force of 1600 men under Major Walker to act with the troops
of R√°vji and B√°b√°ji north of
Ahmed√°b√°d. Reinforcements were afterwards sent up, but
the campaign was not closed till April 1802, when the fort of Kadi had
been taken by storm. Malh√°r√°v surrendered and a residence
in <span class="corr" id="xd25e35464" title="Source: Na&#7693;iad">Na&#7693;i√°d</span> was assigned him with
a liberal pension out of the revenues of that sub-division. The fort of
Sankheda, which had been held by Ganpatr√°v G√°ikw√°r
for his cousin Malh√°r√°v, was soon after this reduced and
the country for a time pacified.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The British and the G√°ikw√°r,
1800.</span>In March R√°vji had an interview at Cambay with
Governor Duncan, which was followed on June 6th by a definite treaty,
of which the groundwork had been previously sketched in anticipation of
the reduction of the revolted G√°ikw√°rs. Two thousand men,
besides artillery, were to be subsidized and a
<i>j√°id√°d</i> or assignment for their payment was made on
the revenue of Dholka and the part of Na&#7693;i√°d not assigned
to Malh√°rr√°v. Chikhli was given to the British in reward
for their aid in storming Kadi, and Residents were to be appointed
reciprocally. A large sum of money was borrowed by R√°vji, partly
from Bombay partly from Baroda bankers, to pay off the arrears due to
about 7000 Arab mercenaries, who had usurped a great deal of
objectionable influence in civil affairs at the <span class="corr" id="xd25e35475" title="Source: G√°ikwar&rsquo;s">G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s</span>

appointed Resident and proceeded to Baroda on 8th June.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s Minister
R√°vji.</span>On the same day was signed a secret compact
assuring R√°vji of the support of the British Government and
awarding him a village out of the territory ceded by the treaty of June
6th. It was deemed advisable by the British Government to have at the
Baroda court some leading personage who might, in the present state of
the relations between Bombay and Poona, further the designs of the
former government in preventing a recurrence of the coalition of
Mar√°tha powers. R√°vji was sure of his reward if he served
British interests, whilst in case of the reorganization of a
Mar√°tha confederacy the state he was administering would
probably play but a very subordinate part in subsequent events.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty of Bassein, 31st Dec.
1802.</span>The treaty of June 6th was disapproved by the Court of
Directors as being in direct contravention of the treaty of
S√°lbai. Before, however, any orders had been issued by the Home
authorities to restore to the G√°ikw√°r the territory he
had ceded, the Peshwa, out of regard for whom the treaty had been
disavowed, was a fugitive before the army of Holkar, and by December
had ratified these very concessions at the treaty of Bassein. By this
treaty the Peshwa virtually placed his independence in the hands of the
British. He ceded his share of Surat, thus giving them sole control
over that district. In payment of the subsidiary force required he
handed over territory in Gujar√°t, the revenue of which amounted
to 12,28,000 rupees, and finally he constituted the British Government
arbiter in the disputes between his government and that of Baroda. The
grants made by the G√°ikw√°r for the support of the
subsidiary force amounted in 1802 to 7,80,000 rupees.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Arabs Disbanded.</span>Major Walker
attempted to negotiate with the Arab guard, but the greater part of
them flew to arms and released K√°nhoji G√°ikw√°r.
The latter then tried to collect an army near Baroda, and succeeded in
obtaining possession of the person of &Aacute;nandr√°v the
titular ruler. The British force then took Baroda by storm, after which
most of the Arabs submitted, except a few who joined K√°nhoji.
The rest took the arrears due to them and left the country.
K√°nhoji was not subdued till February 1803. <span class="marginnote">Malh√°rr√°v in Revolt,

and was plundering the Mar√°tha possessions there.
B√°b√°ji &Aacute;pp√°ji and a young officer named
Vithal Dev√°ji (or Div√°nji) led the operations against
him; and to the latter belongs the honour of having captured this
troublesome member of the ruling family. The estate of
Na&#7693;i√°d, which had been assigned to Madhavr√°o by
Govindr√°v, was resumed by R√°vji &Aacute;pp√°ji and
made over in its entirety to the British Government. A treaty,
supplementary to that of 1802, was drawn up guaranteeing this cession
as well as the <i>in√°m</i> or free gift of the fort and district
of Kaira, &ldquo;out of gratitude for the support given in the recent
troubles to the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s honour and for assistance
in securing the good of the State.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span></p>

agreement R√°vji applied for an addition to the subsidiary force,
in payment of which he assigned M√°tar Mahudha and the customs of
Kim-Kathodra, a station about seventeen miles north of Surat. His
reason for strengthening the subsidiary force appears to have been that
owing to the reduction of the Arabs, his own force was not enough to
guard even the frontier, and that a great part of that duty fell on the
European contingent, which was numerically insufficient for service on
so extended a scale. <span class="marginnote">Death of R√°vji,

<p><span class="marginnote">War with Sindia.</span>Whilst these
arrangements were being carried out at Baroda, B√°jir√°v
Peshwa, chafing at the dependence to which his straits of the previous
winter had reduced him with regard to the English, was actively
propagating dissension between Sindia and the Calcutta Government. Not
long after, the war that had been some time imminent broke out, and a
contingent of 7352 men from Gujar√°t was ordered to the field. In
August or September Broach and <span class="corr" id="xd25e35535"
title="Source: P√°v√°gad">P√°v√°ga&#7693;</span><a class="noteref"

British.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Revenue Collecting Force.</span>Under
the treaty of Sirj&eacute; Anjangaon in December 1803, both
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35544" title="Source: P√°v√°gad">P√°v√°ga&#7693;</span> and
Dohad were restored to Sindia, but Broach remained British. By this
means one of the rising Mar√°tha powers was extruded from the
centre to the outlying portion of the province. The employment of all
the British contingent against Sindia&rsquo;s possessions in
Gujar√°t precluded Major Walker from furnishing any portion of
the army that was annually sent to collect the tribute in <span class="corr" id="xd25e35547" title="Source: K√°thi√°va&#7693;a">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>.
R√°vji &Aacute;pp√°ji had expressly stipulated that some
part of the contingent might be so used when it could be spared from
its main duties. The Supreme Government agreed to the proposal when
made by Governor Duncan, on the grounds of the advantage both to the
G√°ikw√°r and the tributaries of employing on this
disagreeable duty a strong and well-disciplined force. Already some of
the tributaries had made overtures to Major Walker with a view to
obtaining British protection against powerful neighbours. Governor
Duncan was in favour of accepting the duty of protection and also of
helping the <span class="corr" id="xd25e35550" title="Source: G√°ikwar&rsquo;s">G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s</span>
commander in his expeditions through the peninsula on these grounds.
Firstly, the officer in command could exercise a certain supervision
over the collections in which the British as part assignees had a
direct interest. Secondly, a way could thus be opened for the
acquisition of a port on the coast from which the intrigues, supposed
to be carried on by agents from the Isle of France, could be watched
and counteracted. From such a point, too, the views of the Bombay
Government as regards Kachh could be promoted. Thirdly, the commandant
could take steps to improve the system of forcible collections, and
towards abolishing the barbarous features of this rude method of
levying tribute. He could also, perhaps, suggest some system by which
the advantages of all three parties concerned would be better secured
than by reliance on the uncertainty of temporary expeditions. The
fourth and last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415"

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> reason given savours
strongly of the Mar√°tha policy of the time, of which the leading
maxim was <i lang="la">Divide et impera</i>. It was represented that
B√°b√°ji, who had successfully collected the tribute during
1802&ndash;03 and whose subordinate and companion Vithal Dev√°ji
was a person of similar energy and capability, might possibly acquire
too great influence if left in a quasi-independent command at such a
distance from the Court. It was politic, then, to join with the force
under his command a strong foreign body, thus dividing both the power
and the responsibility. The war with Sindia caused these proposals to
fall into abeyance for some time.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Renewal of Farm, 1804.</span>Meanwhile the
Resident at Poona was doing his best to secure for the
G√°ikw√°r a further lease for ten years of the farm of the
Peshwa&rsquo;s dominions in Gujar√°t, so that the inconveniences
of dual government might be avoided. In October 1804 a ten years&rsquo;
farm was granted in the name of Bhagvantr√°v
G√°ikw√°r at an annual rate of 4&frac12; l√°khs of
rupees.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The British and the G√°ikw√°r,
1805.</span>This grant led to the consolidation of all previous
engagements into a single treaty, which was signed in April 1805.
Previous agreements were confirmed and the whole brought into
consonance with the treaty of Bassein. Districts yielding 11,70,000
rupees per annum were made over for the support of the subsidiary
force, and arrangements were also made for the repayment of the cash
loan advanced by the British Government in 1802, when the liquidation
of the arrears due to the Arabs was a matter of urgent political
necessity. The British contingent was to be available in part for
service in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, whenever the British
Government thought such an employment of it advisable.</p>
<p>Finally, the British Government was constituted arbiter in all
disputes of the G√°ikw√°r, not alone with foreign powers,
but also in the adjustment of his financial transactions with the
Peshwa his paramount power. These transactions, which ranged back from
the capture of D√°m√°ji in 1751, had never been the subject
of a formal investigation, and were by this time complicated by the
numerous engagements with third parties into which both governments had
been obliged to enter at their various moments of distress.
B√°jir√°v, who was apparently intriguing for a
Mar√°tha coalition against his new protectors, was careful not to
bring before the notice of the chiefs, whose esteem he wished to gain,
a provision which exhibited him as in any way dependent upon the
arbitration of a foreign power. He therefore granted the farm for ten
years to the G√°ikw√°r, as much by way of remanding for a
time the proposed inquiries and settlement of their respective claims
as for the purpose of diverting the attention of the British to the
administration of this new appanage, whilst leaving him free scope for
his intrigues in the Dakhan. He used, moreover, every pretext to defer
the consideration of the G√°ikw√°r question until he could
make use of his claims to further his own designs. His success in
preventing a discussion of these transactions is apparent by the fact
that in the financial statement of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s
affairs made by Colonel Walker in 1804, no mention of the Poona demand
is to be found. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416"

<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> No important event took
place during the next year or two. B√°b√°ji relinquished
the command of the force in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a in
favour of Vithalr√°v Dev√°ji, whilst he himself took part
in the civil administration at Baroda. The Resident, too, seems to have
been likewise engaged in internal matters and in securing the country
against an invasion by K√°nhoji, now a fugitive at the court of
Holkar.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1807.</span>In 1807 the Resident made over
&Aacute;ba Shelukar, late Sar Subhed√°r of the Peshwa, to the
British Government, by whom he could be prevented from engaging in
fresh conspiracies. After this Colonel Walker was at last enabled to
leave Baroda in order to assist in the settlement of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a tribute question, an object he
had long had in view, but which the necessity for his continuous
presence at the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s capital had hitherto
prevented him from undertaking.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
Tribute.</span>The changes with regard to the collection of the tribute
from the chiefs of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a that were
carried out in 1807 deserve a special description. Firstly, they placed
the relations of the tributary to the paramount power on quite a new
basis. Secondly, by them the British influence over both parties
concerned was much increased and the connection between the governments
of Bombay and Baroda drawn closer. Thirdly, they were subsequently, as
will be seen hereafter, the subject of much discussion and delay in the
settlement of the questions at issue between the Peshwa and the
G√°ikw√°r. And lastly, their effect was most beneficial to
both the chiefs and their subjects in removing the uncertainty that had
hitherto pervaded the whole revenue administration of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.</p>
<p>Before entering on the details of the settlement itself, some
description is necessary of the social and political state of the
peninsula at the time the changes were introduced.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">State of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, 1807.</span>The greater part of
the population of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a consisted of
two classes, chiefs and cultivators, called Bhumi√°s and ryots.
The power of the chief ranged from the headship of a single village up
to absolute jurisdiction over several score. The ryots were usually
tenants long resident in the province. The chiefs were in almost every
case foreigners, invaders from the north and north-east; Muhammadan
adventurers from the court of Ahmed√°b√°d; K√°this
animated by the love of plunder and cattle-lifting; and
Mi√°n√°s and V√°ghel√°s who had settled on the
coast on account of the facilities it afforded for their favourite
pursuits of wrecking and piracy. More numerous than any others were the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35609" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>, driven south by the disturbed
state of their native kingdoms or by the restless spirit of military
adventure to be found in a class where one profession alone is
honourable. There is a certain uniformity in the building up of all
these chieftainships. A powerful leader, with a sufficient band of
followers, oppressed his weaker neighbours till they were glad to come
to terms and place themselves under his protection, so as both to
escape themselves and to take their chance of sharing in the plunder of
others. It frequently happened in the growth of one of these states
that the <i>bh√°y√°d</i> or relations of the chief (who are
sure to be numerous in a polygamous society) were influential enough to
assume, in their turn, a partial independence and to claim recognition

State of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, 1807.</span> as a
separate state. As a rule, however, they continued to unite with the
head of the family against external foes, and only disagreed as to
domestic administration. It is also noticeable that though so addicted
to the profession of arms, the <span class="corr" id="xd25e35630"
title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> cannot be called a
military race; they possess few of the true military virtues; hence the
slowness of their advance, and their failure in competition with
perhaps less courageous though more compact and pliable races. In
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a fortified strongholds, formidable
enough to an army moving rapidly without siege trains, arose in all
directions, and even villages were surrounded by a high mud wall as a
protection against cattle-lifters.</p>
<p>The groundwork of these states being itself so unstable, their
relations with each other were conducted on no principle but the law of
the stronger. General distrust reigned throughout. Each chief well knew
that his neighbours had won their position as he had won his own by the
gradual absorption of the weaker, and that they were ready enough
whenever opportunity offered to subject his dominions to the same
process. The administration of his territory consisted merely in
levying, within certain limits sanctioned by long usage, as much
revenue as would suffice to maintain himself and his forces in their
position with regard to the surrounding states. When a foreign enemy
appeared there was no co-operation amongst the local chiefs in
resistance. It was a point of honour not to yield except to a superior
force. Each chief, therefore, resisted the demands made upon him until
he considered that he had done enough to satisfy the family conscience
and then, agreeing to the terms proposed, he allowed the wave of
extortion to pass on and deluge the domains of his neighbour. It should
be remembered that the peninsula had never been subjugated, though
overrun times innumerable. The evil of invasion was thus transitory. To
a chief the mere payment of tribute tended in no wise to derogate from
his independence. In his capacity of military freebooter he
acknowledged the principle as just. His country had been won by the
sword and was retained by the sword and not by acquiescence in the
payment of tribute, so that if he could avoid this extortion he was
justified in doing so. If he weakened his state in resisting
foreigners, he knew that his neighbours would certainly take advantage
of the favourable juncture and annex his territory. It was his policy
therefore, after resistance up to a certain point, to succumb.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Revenue Raid System.</span>Owing to
this local peculiarity and to the general want of union in the
province, both the Mughals and Mar√°th√°s found it
advantageous to follow a system of successive expeditions rather than
to incur the expense of permanently occupying the peninsula with an
army which would necessarily have to be a large one. There is every
reason to believe that in adopting the raid system the Musalm√°ns
were only pursuing the practice of their predecessors, who used to take
tribute from Jodhpur to Dw√°rka.</p>
<p>Some of the subhed√°rs of Ahmed√°b√°d divided
their tributary district into three circuits of collection and
personally undertook the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

The Revenue Raid System.</span> charge of one each year. This was the
<i>mulakgiri</i> <span class="corr" id="xd25e35659" title="Source: Land-raiding">land-raiding</span> system. Besides this chief
expedition, there was the smaller one of the B√°bi of
Jun√°ga&#7693;h and the still more minute operations of the
R√°val of Bh√°vnagar against some of his weaker neighbours.
The great Ahmed√°b√°d expedition had long been an annual
grievance and was conducted with some show of system and under special
rules called the <i>Raj-ul-Mulak</i>. Three of these rules are of
importance, and seem to have been generally acquiesced in before the
great incursions of B√°b√°ji and Vithalr√°v at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. The first was that the paramount
power (by which was meant the foreign government which was strong
enough to enforce tribute from all the chiefs) had authority to
interfere in cases of dismemberment, or in proceedings tending to the
depreciation of the revenue or to the dismemberment of any tributary
state. It was again an acknowledged rule that whilst the mulakgiri
expedition of the paramount power was in motion no other army should be
in the field throughout the whole province. The third provision was not
so well established, but it appears to have been understood that the
tribute from each state should be regulated by some standard of former
date. In practice, however, the measure of the Mar√°tha demand
was simply the power to enforce payment.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that about the beginning of this century the
resistance to the collection of tribute was stronger towards the west
than in the east and south of the province. In the Mahi K√°ntha
the lawlessness of the Koli chiefs, who had established themselves in
the ravines and on the hills, necessitated the employment of a military
force for collections. In the neighbourhood of Bij√°pur and Kadi,
the chiefs would not pay tribute except under the compulsion of a siege
or raid, but the mulakgiri system only reached its full development
west of Dholka.</p>
<p>From these explanatory remarks the system and practice of the
Mar√°th√°s can be clearly understood.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <span class="corr" id="xd25e35672"
title="Source: M√°r√°th√°s">Mar√°th√°s</span>
in Sorath.</span>The Mar√°th√°s found their way to Sorath
very early in their Gujar√°t career. The first raid probably took
place about 1711, when the Muhammadans were occupied near
Ahmed√°b√°d. After this incursions were frequent, and under
D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r became, as has been seen
above, annual. This leader did more. He took to wife a daughter of the
Gohil chief of the small state of L√°thi in east central
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, whose dowry in land gave him the
standpoint he sought in the heart of the peninsula. He managed also to
secure his position in what are known as the Amreli Mah√°ls,
probably under the force of circumstances similar to those which caused
the weaker <span class="corr" id="xd25e35676" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> to gravitate towards the
stronger of their own tribe. His expedition through the peninsula,
generally as near the time of harvest as possible, was made regularly
every year as soon as he had amassed a sufficient number of troops on
the mainland to admit of a force being detached for mulakgiri. The
object of these inroads was plunder, not conquest; the leaders would
readily have entered into negotiations for the payment of the tribute
had the chieftains been disposed to treat otherwise than after defeat.
The expenses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
The Mar√°th√°s in Sorath.</span> of such an army were
heavy, and the more so as the time during which it would be in the
field was quite indefinite, and dependent entirely upon the amount of
resistance offered. In more than one instance the Mar√°tha
leaders, who usually had no artillery for a siege, were obliged to
regularly beleaguer a town. Early in this century the town of
M√°lia successfully defended itself against a remarkably well
equipped force under B√°b√°ji, and the
Jun√°ga&#7693;h state was usually avoided by the
Mar√°th√°s as much as possible on account of the time it
would take to reduce its army to terms.</p>
<p>It is not on record that the mulakgiri force habitually devastated
the country over which it passed, or caused much greater hardships to
the ryots than are inseparable from the passage of an army in the
field. There are, however, well authenticated stories of the
depredations and damage committed during these expeditions. A village
is said to have been deserted by order of the <i>bhumia</i> in order
that the timber of its houses might furnish fuel for the Mar√°tha
army on its march. Tortures were doubtless inflicted on men supposed to
be well off, who were suspected to have hidden their property. A
Mar√°tha army was usually, if not always, ill disciplined, as is
proved by the testimony of Mr. Forbes, an eye witness of the campaigns
of 1775.<a class="noteref" id="n419.1src" href="#n419.1" name="n419.1src">16</a> From the same writer it is learned what an immense
proportion the camp followers bore to the actual combatants. If this
were the case in a real campaign against a formidable and active enemy,
it is likely that the irresponsible element was still larger in an
expedition like this of mulakgiri, where the enemy was insignificant
and the country at the mercy of the invaders. It is probable therefore
that the troops have been credited with misconduct that should in point
of fact be attributed to these Pindh√°ris. In after years, when
the expeditions were conducted systematically, villages on the line of
march were always allowed the alternative of entertaining a pioneer or
two as a sort of guarantee. If no <i>bandh√°ri</i> of this sort
were accepted, the army occupied the place. In many cases the demands
for supplies made by these pioneers were so exorbitant that the
villagers preferred to compound in turn with them also for their
absence. Another method by which a chieftain might avoid the necessity
of the army&rsquo;s passing through his territories was by sending to
the commander of the expedition an envoy empowered to treat for the
amount of tribute and to execute a provisional guarantee for its future
liquidation. This deed was destroyed on the subsequent confirmation by
the chief himself of the agreement for the sum fixed.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Securities.</span>This habit of taking
securities in all engagements was so prevalent in all parts of the
province, and played so prominent a part in the financial
administration of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s home and tributary
domains, that its main features are worth describing.</p>
<p>It is a well known characteristic of Hindu dealings that no
transaction is carried on by two parties alone if a third can possibly
be dragged in. This practice no doubt originated in the former insecure
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
Securities.</span> state of society when no man considered himself safe
in person or property from government on the one hand and his neighbour
on the other. With classes like Kolis and predatory <span class="corr"
id="xd25e35727" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>, the
feeling is intelligible enough, and from these it spread into other
branches of the society. To such a pitch was distrust carried in the
early part of the nineteenth century, that the G√°ikw√°r
himself could find no one to enter into a contract with him without the
guarantee of one of his own subjects. The consequences of this practice
and the power it threw into the hands of the Arab mercenaries, who were
the principal securities for the public debts, are matters that touch
the history of the Baroda State rather than that of the province. The
chiefs in their dealings employed a special sort of security which owed
its validity not to political consideration like that of the Arab
Jam√°d√°rs but entirely to its religious and traditional
character.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Bh√°ts and Ch√°rans,
1807.</span>A society of the military type like the <span class="corr"
id="xd25e35734" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> has a
tendency towards caste and privilege. Without a leader the warlike
instincts of the tribe would not carry them beyond petty robberies;
whilst with a leader they can achieve greater exploits of valour and
destruction. The successful chief then is idolized, and after a certain
stage the privileges of the chieftainship become hereditary. Once this
system is established, the celebration of ancestors follows, and when
circumstances are favourable to the perpetuation of the hereditary
position, the genealogy of the chief is a matter of the highest
importance, and the person entrusted with the record of this is vested
with peculiar sanctity. It is the genealogist&rsquo;s duty to enter in
the record, not only the direct line but the names of the more distant
relations of the chief by whom he is retained, and also to be the
continual chanter of the glorious deeds of their common ancestors. He
is therefore a referee of the highest authority in questions of
pedigree or of the partition of inheritance. An injury to his person
might entail the loss of the pedigree of the ruling family (especially
as many of the bards kept no written record) and thus produce a
misfortune which would be felt by the whole tribe. The chief, being a
warrior, must take his chance in the field with the rest, but the
person of the genealogist was sacred and inviolable. Amongst the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35737" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> the greatest reverence was paid
to purity of pedigree, and each principal family had its Bh√°t to
record births and deaths amongst its members and to stimulate pride in
their lineage by the recital of the wars and exploits of their
ancestors.</p>
<p>These Bh√°ts necessarily multiplied beyond the number of the
families that could entertain them, so that many took to banking and
some to cultivation. Surrounded as they were by the social system of
the Hindus, it was not long before they became differentiated into a
distinct caste, and the inviolability of their persons, formerly due
only to respect for the pedigree, was now extended to the whole tribe,
even though a large proportion of it performed none of the duties of
genealogists. Similar to the Bh√°ts in many respects, notably in
that of sacredness of person, were the Ch√°rans, numerous in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, where they had founded villages
and lived as ordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
Bh√°ts and Ch√°rans, 1807.</span> cultivators. This tribe
also claimed divine origin like the race whose annals they had the
privilege of recording. It is said that R√°ja Todar Mal, the
celebrated minister of the Dehli empire, was the first to introduce the
practice of taking these Bh√°ts as securities for the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e35757" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>. The assertion is possibly
true, but rests merely on tradition, and after ages usually find some
great man as a sponsor for all such innovations. It is clear however
that for many years before 1807 no dealings of Kolis or <span class="corr" id="xd25e35760" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>
with the state or with each other took place without the security of a
Bh√°t being taken. This practice seems to have been as prevalent
on the mainland as in the peninsula, the Kolis having doubtless
borrowed it from their <span class="corr" id="xd25e35763" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> neighbours after the Bh√°ts
had become a separate caste.</p>
<p>Under this system the Bh√°ts acquired considerable wealth, as
they usually demanded a percentage on the amount for which they became
security. There are instances in which they presumed upon the strength
of their engagements and sacred character to bully or dictate to their
employer. Such was the case of the R√°val of Bh√°vnagar in
1808, which is also interesting in another way, as showing how the
spirit of industry and commerce tends to sap the old observances which
have their roots in superstition. This chief engaged in trade, fostered
merchants, and increased his revenue. When his security, a Bh√°t,
got troublesome and interfering, he applied to the power to whom he
paid tribute to have the old security bond cancelled and a fresh one
taken on his own personal responsibility. In doing this he seems to
have been prompted by nothing but his appreciation of the modern code
of commercial honour.</p>
<p>To return to the <i>mulakgiri</i>. The tribute for which preliminary
security had been taken seems to have fluctuated from year to year, but
always with reference to a fixed standard. It was one of the
Mar√°tha rules never to recede from a former demand lest they
should be thereby setting up a precedent for future years. They
preferred to secure a year or two&rsquo;s arrears at the full rate to
the payment of all the arrears due at a reduced rate.</p>
<p>In spite of this fiction of a settled <i>jama</i> or tribute, the
Mar√°th√°s, when they had a sufficient force at their back,
invariably demanded a larger sum, the excess being called
<i>khar√°-j√°t</i> or extra distinct from the actual
tribute. This ingenious plan of increasing the collections originated,
it is said, with Shivr√°m G√°rdi, and was carried out
scrupulously by both B√°b√°ji and Vithalr√°v in their
tours. In fact during the last few years of the old system
Vithalr√°v had so good a force with him that the extra demand
formed a large proportion of the whole tribute collected and had been
paid only under strong protest. <span class="marginnote">British
Intervention.</span>The British had not long been established in
R√°npur, Gogha, and Dhandhuka before a few petty chiefs of
Gohilv√°d and Sorath applied to the Resident at Baroda for
protection against the mulakgiri of the Naw√°b of <span class="corr" id="xd25e35784" title="Source: J&uacute;n√°ga&#7693;h">Jun√°ga&#7693;h</span> and
the R√°val of Bh√°vnagar, offering to cede the sovereignty
of their states to the British on condition that certain rights and
privileges were preserved to the chiefs and their families. The
conditions they named were not such as were likely to meet with the
approval of the British Government, and do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
British Intervention.</span> not seem to have received much
consideration. The proposals had, however, the effect of drawing the
attention of the Bombay Government towards the state of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, and permission to aid the
mulakgiri of the G√°ikw√°r by detaching a few companies of
British troops was accorded by the Supreme Government. The outbreak of
hostilities with Sindia led to the whole question as to the best means
of collecting the tribute being for a time deferred. The internal
disputes of some of the more turbulent states, a few years afterwards,
gave the Resident an opportunity of sending an envoy to one or two
courts to see how matters stood, and to open a way for a settlement in
conjunction with the G√°ikw√°r. Affairs at Baroda, as
mentioned above (page 416), detained the Resident there till 1807, in
which year he joined Vithalr√°v&rsquo;s army with a British
contingent, at a place in the Morvi state.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Settlement of 1807.</span>Before treating
directly with the chiefs a circular was sent round to all of them both
by the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s agent and by Colonel Walker the
Resident, containing the basis of the proposals with regard to the
tribute about to be submitted to them. The position of the British
Government throughout this negotiation is not clearly defined.
Vithalr√°v in his circular mentions indeed that a British force
was with his own, but urges the chiefs to come to a settlement entirely
with the government he represented. Colonel Walker&rsquo;s note was
longer, more explicit, and conciliatory, but at the same time assumes a
tone of protection and superiority. The replies of the chiefs were
various, and, as a rule, seem to show that they regarded the British
Government as the chief mover in these negotiations. They were probably
aware of the position in which the engagements of the
G√°ikw√°r had placed him with reference to the British, and
for some years had had the latter as their neighbours in the east of
the peninsula. They were therefore not able at once to take in the
whole scope of the action of the British Government in the tribute
question.</p>
<p>Many seemed to take the note as a preliminary to a mulakgiri on the
part of the East India Company. The R√°ja of M√°lia, who
had just been causing disturbances in the dominions of all his
neighbours, had repulsed B√°b√°ji and permitted the
self-immolation of a Bh√°t rather than fulfil an engagement,
openly proposed a joint expedition across the Ran to plunder Kachh and
Sindh. From the inquiries made by the Resident and from information
gathered from the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s accounts, it was
anticipated that separate engagements need only be entered into with
the twenty-nine chiefs to whom the circular invitation had been issued,
provided that the rights and interests of subordinate members of the
Bh√°y√°d were clearly defined in the agreement. When,
however, these rights came to be investigated in the light of the
peculiar rules of <span class="corr" id="xd25e35808" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> inheritance, it was found that no
less than one hundred and fifty-three persons had a claim to settle
independently of each other for their tribute. This greatly prolonged
the settlement, but at last the agreements were all framed on one
principle. The amount settled was determined by a close scrutiny of the
collections of past years, and Colonel Walker found it advisable to
make great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> reductions in the item of
extras or <i>khar√°j√°t</i>, for which the later
G√°ekw√°r collectors had such predilection. The engagements
were of the following nature.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Settlement of 1807.<br>
<i>Financial.</i></span>First, the chief bound himself his heirs and
successors to pay at Baroda each year the tribute fixed in perpetuity
in 1807. He also procured a counter security for this payment who
engaged himself in this capacity for ten years. The Honourable
Company&rsquo;s government had then to become security on the part of
the G√°ikw√°r for the fixity of the tribute demanded. This
participation of the British in the engagement was insisted upon by the
chiefs, and in all probability Colonel Walker was not averse from
admitting it. Having thus arranged for the payment of the tribute and
guaranteed the amount to be demanded, it was proposed to take measures
to prevent internal quarrels between the chiefs themselves. The object
of a fixed settlement was simply to remove the necessity for
overrunning the country from time to time with an irregular army and to
protect the chiefs against extortion. It was found that if the army of
the paramount power were removed, all means of keeping order in the
province would be lost, and the internecine feuds of the chiefs would
soon destroy the good effects of the permanent settlement by materially
altering the then existing position of the weaker feudatories and
rendering them unable to pay the tribute. It was also the wish of the
British Government to bring about such a state of things in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a that the presence of an army to
control the chiefs would be wholly uncalled-for and that the chiefs
themselves would co-operate to keep order and maintain the permanent
settlement.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Political.</i></span>A second agreement
therefore was called for from each signatory state of the nature of a
security for good and peaceful conduct. The counter security to this
was usually that of another chief. This bond was perpetual. On the
execution of both these engagements the chief received a
<i>parv√°na</i> or guarantee that the G√°ikw√°r
government would not take from him more than the tribute agreed upon,
and to this deed the countersignature of the Resident on behalf of the
British Government was affixed. This guarantee, like the promise of the
chief himself, was apparently given in perpetuity. It will be noted
that the amount of tribute was fixed permanently, but that it was
considered advisable to renew the security every ten years. It is also
remarkable that, except in the <i>failz√°min</i> or bond for good
behaviour, the name of the Peshwa&rsquo;s government, the rights of
which over the tribute had only been temporarily alienated, does not
appear. The total amount of the tribute thus settled was <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 9,79,882.</p>
<p>By means of these engagements the relations of the tributaries to
their paramount power were made a matter of contract, instead of as
heretofore a series of uncertain and arbitrary exactions dependent upon
the respective means of coercion and resistance.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Peshwa&rsquo;s Share in

Peshwa&rsquo;s Share in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a.</span>
the arrangements that had been made about the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a tribute do not seem to have been
officially communicated to the Peshwa&rsquo;s government. It was not
until 1815, when the Resident at Poona was trying to procure the
renewal of the lease for the G√°ikw√°r, that an account of
the settlement was drawn up in a draft agreement which the Resident
submitted to B√°jir√°v. In this draft the curious mistake
was made of mentioning the settlement instead of only the security bond
as decennial. The Peshwa, whose policy was to protract negotiations,
submitted in his turn a second draft which he said he was willing to
sign. In this he seized at once on the supposition that the tribute was
fixed only for ten years and stipulated for an increase at the
expiration of that period. He also demanded that certain extra
collections should be refunded by the G√°ikw√°r, and
assumed the British Government to have become security for the tribute
owed by the chiefs to his own government.</p>
<p>It was evident that no accord would be reached on the lines of
either of these draft agreements as they stood. Before others were
prepared, Gang√°dhar Sh√°stri had been murdered and the
treaty of June 1817 was a completed act, leaving further negotiations
unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Later Arrangements.</span>Meanwhile the
tribute since the expiry of the farm of 1804 had been collected by a
joint British and G√°ikw√°r expedition, for it was found
that partly from their own disputes and partly owing to the instigation
of the agents of B√°jir√°v, the chiefs were little disposed
to act up to the engagements of 1807, either with respect to tribute or
good conduct. The Peshwa, whose interference in the affairs of the
peninsula had been constantly discouraged, declined to trouble himself
to collect the tribute, the responsibility of which he asserted rested
entirely upon the British and G√°ikw√°r governments. He
subsequently ceded the tribute to the British Government on account of
military expenses. After his fall in 1819 his territories, including
the rights in Gujar√°t, fell to the British Government, and in
1820 the G√°ikw√°r arranged that the whole of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a tribute, except that due from the
districts directly subordinate to Baroda, should be collected by the
agency of the British.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Mahi K√°ntha.</span>Turning to
the events on the mainland, we find that soon after Colonel
Walker&rsquo;s return from the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
expedition, he introduced the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
tribute system into the Mahi K√°ntha, in spite of the opposition
of Sit√°r√°m R√°vji and the anti-English party in the
Darb√°r.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Supplementary Treaty, 1808.</span>The
territory ceded for the payment of the British contingent in 1805 was
found to yield less revenue than had been anticipated, so in 1808 a
treaty supplementary to the consolidating one of 1805 was drawn up,
allotting additional assignments amounting to about 1,76,168 rupees to
the British. This revenue was derived partly from alienated villages in
Na&#7693;i√°d, Mahudha, Dholka, M√°tar, and near the Ranjar
Gh√°t. The <i>gh√°sd√°na</i> or tribute of
Bh√°vnagar was also made over by this agreement. With regard to
this latter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> acquisition, it is to be
noticed that the agreement is drawn up in the name of the Honourable
Company alone, and not in that of the British Government on account of
&Aacute;nandr√°v G√°ikw√°r. It also differs from
other engagements of a similar nature in containing a provision against
the contingency of future irregular demands being made by the
Peshwa&rsquo;s army. The reason for this distinction is evidently that
the Bh√°vnagar contribution was not part of the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a revenue farmed to the
G√°ikw√°r by B√°jir√°v, and was thus not
divisible on the expiration of the lease. The right to this tribute
rested with the British by virtue of the previous cession of Gogha, of
which sub-division the fifty nine villages of the Bh√°vnagar
Bh√°y√°d formed part.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Okh√°mandal, 1809.</span>Next year
the Okh√°mandal chiefs, who had not come under the settlement of
1807, were driven to engage not to continue their piratical
depredations along the coast, and to admit one Sundarji Shivji as
Resident on behalf of the British Government. The G√°ikw√°r
government then, too, seems to have become their counter security, an
arrangement which led to misunderstandings a short while
afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disturbances in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, 1811.</span>In 1811, some
disturbances in Nav√°nagar and Jun√°ga&#7693;h and symptoms
of discontent in Okh√°mandal took the Resident from Baroda into
the peninsula with part of the British contingent.</p>
<p>The J√°m of Nav√°nagar had got involved in pecuniary
transactions with the R√°v of Kachh, and the British Government
had mediated with a view of arranging for the repayment by gradual
instalments. The J√°m, however, repudiated all the engagements of
1807 both as regards the debt and the tribute, ejected the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s agent from his dominions, and prepared
for war. He also began to incite the neighbouring chiefs to join in
sweeping out the paramount power from the whole of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. It was not till after a
considerable show of force that he laid down his arms and came to
terms. Captain Carnac, the Resident, got him to submit the Kachh claims
to the arbitration of the English Government, and after fixing them at
<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 4,33,830, Captain Carnac made an
arrangement similar to that originally intended.</p>
<p>There remained the question of a disputed succession in
Jun√°ga&#7693;h. Bah√°dur Kh√°n, son of a slave girl,
was put forward in opposition to a younger aspirant, Sal√°bat
Kh√°n, reputed to be the son of a lady of the R√°dhanpur
house. The Baroda government with the concurrence of the Resident had
admitted the claims of the latter. On a report, however, by the
Assistant Resident in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a<span class="corr" id="xd25e35915" title="Source: .">,</span> Captain Carnac was
induced to alter his opinion and to support Bah√°dur Kh√°n,
on the grounds that Sal√°bat Kh√°n was a spurious child,
and that Bah√°dur was ready to make concessions of value to the
G√°ikw√°r government. The Bombay Council, however,
disavowed all countenance of the claims of Bah√°dur Kh√°n,
and the matter was let drop.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1812.</span>In the year 1812 the

<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.</span> remained the debts for
which that government had become <i>bhand√°ri</i> or security in
place of the ejected <i>jam√°d&acirc;rs</i> of the Arab force.
These claims could not be paid off for at least two years longer, so
that for that period the Resident was ordered to maintain the same
close supervision of Baroda affairs as heretofore.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1813&ndash;14.</span>The next two years
were spent chiefly in discussions with the Poona government about the
old claims by the Peshwa on the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s estate.
There is no doubt that at the time of his death, D√°m√°ji
had not paid up nearly all that he had bound himself in 1753 to pay. On
the other hand there had been at least six intermediate compacts
between the Peshwa and various members of the G√°ikw√°r
family. Amongst others was that of 1768 fixing the arrears of the
previous three years, that of 1778 and of 1781, by the tenth clause of
which Fatehsingh was excused payment of arrears for the time during
which he was engaged in hostilities against R√°ghob√°. Then
came the agreement with Govindr√°v in 1797, to which a sort of
debit and credit account is appended.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Peshwa Intrigue in Baroda, 1814.</span>The
Peshwa had been content, for reasons that have been shown above, to let
these claims lie dormant during the currency of the ten years&rsquo;
farm. But, as the question of the renewal of this agreement became
imminent, he gradually opened more frequent communications with the
Baroda council, using these claims as a pretext for sounding the
disposition of the chief officials and ascertaining their feelings
especially towards the British Government. When the negotiations for
the settlement of these claims were fairly set on foot, he used every
possible means to protract them till he had finally decided what he
should do in 1814, when the Ahmed√°b√°d farm expired.</p>
<p>It was easy for B√°jir√°v to discover who were the
malcontents at the Baroda Court. Sit√°r√°m, the adopted son
of R√°vji &Aacute;pp√°ji, having been found both
incompetent and untrustworthy in the management of affairs, had been
practically removed from any post of influence in the council, and was
moreover chafing at the refusal of the British Government to recognize
him in the same way as they had done his father. He had also been
superseded as Suba of K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a by
Vithalr√°v Dev√°ji. Under these circumstances, and finding
that he had the support of a large number of the older court party
against the authority of the Resident and of his native agent, he
either himself opened communications with B√°jir√°v or
readily listened to the counsels sent to him direct from Poona. Before
long, agents were sent to the Peshwa&rsquo;s Court by Takhtb√°i,
wife of &Aacute;nandr√°v, with instructions, it is supposed, to
thwart all the proposals and designs of Gang√°dhar
Sh√°stri, who had been recently sent as envoy by the
G√°ikw√°r council of administration. The chief obstacle to
the settlement of the Peshwa&rsquo;s claims was the counter-demand made
by the Baroda government on account of Broach, which had been disposed
of without the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s consent, and also on
account of the damage caused by the inroads of &Aacute;ba Shelukar,
when accredited agent of B√°jir√°v in Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>There is no need to detail here the events that took place in Poona
during these negotiations. On the expiration of the farm in 1814,

<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
Peshwa Intrigue in Baroda, 1814.</span> B√°jir√°v appointed
Trimbakji Dengle Sarsuba of Ahmed√°b√°d. The latter,
however, did not leave Poona, where his presence was indispensable to
his master, but sent agents with instructions rather of a political
than of a fiscal nature. He himself undertook the task of disposing of
Gang√°dhar Sh√°stri, whom he caused to be assassinated at
Pandharpur in July 1815.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the J√°m of Nav√°nagar had died leaving a
disputed succession. The chief&rsquo;s Khav√°s or family slaves,
instigated probably by agents from Ahmed√°b√°d, began to
usurp the government, and the whole question was submitted by the
Darb√°r to the Peshwa as being lord paramount. The
Ahmed√°b√°d commander sent a body of two hundred cavalry to
Nav√°nagar, but before they could arrive, the
Khav√°s&rsquo; revolt had been quelled by a British force
detached from the contingent. They therefore dispersed through the
province inciting discontent and revolt amongst the J√°ts and
K√°this. In Kaira they instigated a tribe of Kolis to attack the
British lines by night. Sit√°r√°m R√°vji&rsquo;s
adherents also collected a force at Dh√°r, a state well-known for
lending itself for such purposes, and kept the frontier in confusion.
Severe measures at Poona and Baroda soon put an end to this state of
things, and at last Trimbakji Dengle was surrendered to the British
Government to answer for his share in the murder of Gang√°dhar
Sh√°stri. The discussion of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s
debts, however, was carried on all through the year at Poona, whilst
B√°jir√°v was maturing his then vacillating plans for
extirpating the British from the west of India.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Okh√°mandal ceded to the
G√°ikw√°r.</span>In 1816 the chiefs of Okh√°mandal
again betook themselves to piracy. Their territory was occupied by a
British force. It will be remembered that in 1809 the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s government had become counter security
for these chiefs, but owing to the distance of the district from a
military post, the Baroda authorities found themselves unable to spare
troops enough to put a check on the misconduct of their tributaries. In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1816, at the time of occupation, the
Bombay Government informed the Baroda administration that they had no
wish to permanently establish themselves at so distant a spot, which
contained, moreover, a much frequented shrine of Hindu worship, and
that they were willing to put the G√°ikw√°r in possession
if he would engage to keep up a sufficient force in the district to
protect the neighbouring ports and shores from the pirates and wreckers
that infested the island of Dw√°rk√° and the adjoining
mainland. The Bombay Government made a point of asserting on this
occasion, in opposition apparently to some proposal by the Baroda
Darb√°r, that they could not admit that the mere fact of having
become security or counter-security gave any preferential right to the
possession of the country. Finally, the G√°ikw√°r
government agreed to the condition proposed, and the district was made
over to them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">British Aid at

backed by the Arab mercenaries. After a settlement of this dispute had
been satisfactorily brought about, the Naw√°b, in gratitude,
waived his rights to tribute over the territories recently ceded to

peninsula, where his family had formerly great influence and
considerable property. The escape of Trimbakji Dengle from
Th√°na, and the subsequent attempts of the Peshwa to prevent the
re-capture of his favourite and to re-unite the Mar√°tha
confederacy, led to the execution of a fresh treaty on June 13th, 1817,
in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Government.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty of Poona, 1817.</span>It was
intended to bind the Peshwa in such a way that he could never again
enjoy the ascendancy amongst the Mar√°tha chiefs to which he
aspired. The Resident at Poona took this opportunity of also putting an
end to the discussions about the mutual claims on each other by the
Poona and Baroda governments. The Peshwa agreed to abandon all claims
on any territory in possession of the G√°ikw√°r and to
accept an annual payment of four l√°khs of rupees in satisfaction
of all previous debts. The farm of Gujar√°t was made perpetual to
the G√°ikw√°r on the payment of four and a half
l√°khs annually, but the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
tribute was made over to the British Government in liquidation of
military expenses. The latter Government, by this treaty, also entered
into possession of the Peshwa&rsquo;s revenue in Gujar√°t, except
that of Ulp√°d, which had been assigned to a favourite officer.
All the Peshwa&rsquo;s rights north of the Narbada were also ceded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Treaty with the G√°ikw√°r,
1817&ndash;18.</span>These conditions necessitated a readjustment of
the agreements with the G√°ikw√°r. On November 1817, a
definitive treaty, afterwards supplemented by one of November 1818, was
executed between the Baroda and British Governments. The force
furnished by the former state was found inefficient and the employment
of a larger body of British troops was therefore necessary. To pay for
these the G√°ikw√°r ceded his share in the fort of
Ahmed√°b√°d and the districts immediately surrounding that
city.<a class="noteref" id="n428.1src" href="#n428.1" name="n428.1src">17</a> He also made over some districts near Surat, and the
town of Umreth in Kaira with the whole of the rights acquired by the
perpetual farm of Ahmed√°b√°d. The British remitted the
<i>mughl√°i</i> or dues taken by the Naw√°bs of Surat on
the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s possessions near that city.
Okh√°mandal having now been pacified, was also given up to the
G√°ikw√°r, but revolted four months afterwards and was not
again subdued for a considerable time.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">1819.</span>At the final settlement of the
dominions of the late Peshwa in 1819, the whole of his rights in
Gujar√°t passed in sovereignty to the British, who remitted the
four l√°khs due from the G√°ikw√°r in composition of
arrears claimed by B√°jir√°v. <span class="marginnote">1820.</span>The next year a special inquiry was made into
the respective shares of the Peshwa and Baroda governments in the

<i>gh√°s-d√°na</i> allowance. In the course of this inquiry
so many abuses of power and instances of extortion on the part of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s officers were brought to light, that the

deterioration in the province since the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Close of the Mar√°tha Supremacy, 1819.</span>
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s troops were stationed there, prevailed
upon Say√°jir√°v, who had now succeeded to the throne, to
let the duty of collection be undertaken and superintended by a British
officer stationed in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a, who should,
however, employ the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s troops on occasions
of necessity. A similar arrangement was made with regard to the Mahi
K√°ntha, where the effects of the settlement of 1811 had been
much weakened by the disorderly conduct of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s troops stationed there. The
administration of nearly the whole of the province passed into the
hands of the British and the period of Mar√°tha ascendancy came
to an end.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">General Review.</span>It remains to review
generally the nature and characteristics of the Mar√°tha
connection with Gujar√°t, the chief events in which have been
chronicled above. The most prominent feature has already been indicated
at the beginning of this section and is apparent throughout the whole
narrative. It is, in fact, the small space in history occupied during
this period by the people, compared with the share appropriated to the
actions of the government and its delegates. The reasons for this are
as easily seen as the fact itself. From first to last the
Mar√°tha interests in Gujar√°t were, except at one or two
special junctures, simply pecuniary ones. In comparison with other
countries within reach of Mar√°tha arms, Gujar√°t has
always had a very large proportion of inhabitants engaged in commerce
and manufacturing industries. It was the object of &#346;iv√°ji
to get as much booty as he could and carry it away then and there;
hence the commercial classes and manufacturers presented the most
favourable opportunities for pillage, and the agriculturists were at
first only mulcted in forage and provisions. Rapidity of action was
another of &#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s aims, so not only were his visits
short and their effects transitory, but all his booty consisted of
property that could be carried away by his horsemen. No women or
followers accompanied his expeditions, no prisoners were made excepting
the few who could afford to pay a heavy ransom. Torture was resorted to
only when the captive was suspected of having concealed his treasure.
Cows women and cultivators were, according to
&#346;iv√°ji&rsquo;s system, exempted from capture. Assignments
on revenue were seldom made by him for fear of weakening his own
authority. Subsequently the Mar√°tha demands became more regular
and assumed the form of a certain proportion of the revenue. The
<i>sar-deshmukhi</i> and <i>chauth</i> were supposed to be calculated
on the standard assessment so as to avoid subsequent claims as tribute
or over-collection. In reality, however, they consisted of a fixed
share in actual collections together with whatever extras the officer
in charge could manage to extort, and which were, of course, kept
undefined in any agreement. The expeditions, too, moved more leisurely
and in greater force. The passes and roads in their rear were protected
by their own comrades, so that the booty could be brought to the Dakhan
in carts, and more bulky property therefore was removed than in former
times. The times, too, when the demands were likely to be made were
known to the headmen of the district and village, so that the
cultivators could be pressed beforehand to furnish their share of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
General Review.</span> contributions. The extortion by this means
passed from the commercial classes down to the agriculturists, the
latter having also the burden of supporting a larger and more cumbrous
army for a longer period.</p>
<p>When the power of the D√°bh√°de and his deputy the
G√°ikw√°r was fairly established, a regular system of
administration was introduced. It will be remembered that by the treaty
of 1729 as few Mar√°tha officers were to be employed as possible
beyond those necessary to collect the D√°bh√°de&rsquo;s
share of the revenue. In consequence, however, of the internal
struggles of the Muhammadan chiefs, this minimum quota grew to be a
large establishment, with the usual accompaniment of alienations and
assignments for the support of the officers and their religious
institutions which the weakness of the central power had allowed to
become customary. The D√°bh√°de himself was non-resident
and his deputy usually being too valuable an assistant to be spared
from the arena of Dakhan politics, the collection was left to
sub-deputies and their subordinates, who in turn delegated a great part
of their duties to village officers and even to strangers. The
D√°bh√°des, who were throughout more interested in the
Dakhan than in Gujar√°t, had, no doubt, an idea of raising up a
power in the latter province in opposition to the administration of the
Peshwa, which was conducted purely by Br√°hman agency. It was
soon evident, however, that all that could be done politically with
Gujar√°t was to make it a treasury for the support of schemes
that had to be carried out in the Dakhan.</p>
<p>The fertility of the soil and the facilities the country afforded
for commerce and manufactures both tended to make it unlikely to become
a field for recruiting. The inhabitants of the towns had fixed and
lucrative occupations; the cultivators were mostly of a class which on
account of the fertility of their land neither Muhammadan nor
Mar√°tha had been able to impoverish. The Mar√°th√°s
had still to seek for soldiers in the rugged and barren country on the
Gh√°ts and in the Konkan, where the people could only look for a
hand-to-mouth existence if they remained at home. The warlike tribes of
Gujar√°t were, as has been already seen, too proud by birth and
position to engage themselves to fight for any but their own race and
interest. The aboriginal races were not likely to prove effective
allies even if they had been willing to move from their own woods and
fortresses. None of the Mar√°tha governors of <span class="corr"
id="xd25e36067" title="Source: Guj√°rat">Gujar√°t</span>
seem to have consistently attempted to weld the various interests
subordinate to them into a cohesion and unity that they might have made
politically useful against the Poona influence. All that they
endeavoured to do was to draw from their charge as much revenue as
possible and to keep out interlopers. To the taxpayer the result was
the same, whether his district was invaded by Kant√°ji or
Pil√°ji. If one anticipated the other in carrying off the
harvest, the ryot still had to pay the latter for ejecting the
intruder. The only resistance to be feared by the
Mar√°th√°s was that, not of the cultivators, but of their
own race or of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e36070" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> Gir√°si√°s. These
latter were treated in all districts as mere robbers, probably because
the class which bears that name near R√°jpipla<span class="corr"

General Review.</span> where the Mar√°th√°s first came in
contact with it subsists usually on blackmail. In the north, however,
the Gir√°si√°s were landowners of great influence and fixed
residence, not likely to be conciliated by the knowledge that the
invaders of their country classed them along with Bhils and Kolis as
<i>mehv√°sis</i> or outlaws.</p>
<p>In order to relieve the chief officials of direct responsibility for
the revenue, the G√°ikw√°r towards the last quarter of the
eighteenth century if not before, introduced the system of letting out
each revenue sub-division in farm for from one to five years at a fixed
annual rate. The farmer was as often as not an absentee, but the
supervision and administration were never entrusted to any one but a
Mar√°tha Br√°hman. The revenue for the year was settled by
an inspection of the accounts of previous years and the crops of each
village. The amount was taken in kind, but the actual distribution of
the whole on individual cultivators was left to the headman, who was in
most cases made responsible for the assessment imposed on his
village.</p>
<p>The frequent passages of hostile armies and other causes had left
much culturable land a desert. In order to restore the population and
induce colonists to settle and cultivate in such spots, leases on
favourable terms were granted to des√°is, who administered the
land as they pleased, and were directly responsible to the head revenue
authority of the sub-division for the annual rent. The patels and other
village officials also made use of their position with reference to the
foreign supervisors in appropriating large tracts of waste land to
their own uses. The <i>kam√°v&iacute;sd√°r</i> or farmer
for the time being was interested only in recouping himself for the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e36101" title="Source: amout">amount</span>
he had agreed to pay the Mar√°tha government, together with a
margin for bribes paid to underlings at head-quarters for good offices
with regard to the farm. He was ready, therefore, to make use of any
agency in collecting his revenue that he found effective, and which
saved the cost of a personal establishment. In many parts of the
country there were hereditary village headmen accustomed to the duty of
extorting money from unwilling ryots. In other places, such for
instance as Dholka, it had been customary for certain Muhammadans
called Kasb√°tis, to become responsible for the revenue of
certain villages in return for a discount on the <i>jama</i> or amount
collected (<i>manoti</i>). These <i>manotid√°rs</i> were found so
useful by the Mar√°tha officials that they gradually acquired an
hereditary position and claimed proprietary rights in the villages for
which they had been formerly mere agents for collection. They also
acted as <i>des√°is</i> or colonists, and succeeded in getting
their leases of certain tracts renewed long after they had ceased to
actively improve the land, which had in fact been all brought under
regular cultivation.</p>
<p>Such was the agency employed in administering the revenue. The
<i>kam√°v&iacute;sd√°r</i> was also the dispenser of
justice both civil and criminal. As his object was to make money and
not to improve the condition of his charge, his punishments consisted
chiefly in fines, and most offences could be paid for. No record of
trials was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">The Mar√°th√°s</span>, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1760&ndash;1819.<br>
General Review.</span> kept except a memorandum of the amount passed at
each decision to the credit of the farmer. In civil suits sometimes
one-fourth of the amount in dispute was assigned as costs and
appropriated by the court. The Gir√°si√°s in their own
territory exercised somewhat similar jurisdiction, but grave crimes
with violence were apparently left to the party injured or his
relations to decide after the manner of the offence. Arbitration, too,
was a frequent mode of deciding differences of both civil and criminal
nature, but the <i>kam√°v&iacute;sd√°r</i> or
<i>gir√°si√°</i> usually managed that the State should not
be a loser by such a method of settlement.</p>
<p>The whole system indicates clearly enough the slight hold the
Mar√°th√°s had on the province and their desire to make the
most out of it for the furtherance of court intrigues or political ends
above the Gh√°ts. There is nothing to show that they contemplated
a permanent colonization of the country until the British Government
undertook the task of dividing the Mar√°tha nation by the
establishment of a powerful and independent court at Baroda.</p>
<p>The home of the Mar√°th√°s was always the Dakhan, and
for many years after they had effected a lodgment in Gujar√°t,
their army regularly returned for the rainy season to the country from
whence they originally came. Their leaders were encouraged to be as
much as possible near the court by the D√°bh√°de, or the
regent on the one side and by the Peshwa on the other: the former on
account of their weight with the army and the Mar√°tha chiefs,
the latter in order that their influence in a distant dependency might
not grow beyond what prudence recommended or might be counteracted if
its tendency to increase became manifest. For similar reasons no force
was allowed to be maintained in Gujar√°t sufficient to
consolidate the Mar√°tha acquisitions there into a manageable
whole. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, had he lived, would
undoubtedly have done much towards this end by means of his personal
influence; but, as it happened, the thin crust of Mar√°tha
domination rapidly disappeared before it either was assimilated into
the system of the province or hardened over it. A military occupation
of a large and civilised district at a distance from the
mother-country, and prevented by the jealousy of the central authority
and the short-sightedness of those in charge of its exploitation, from
either conforming itself to the elements it found already established,
or absorbing the vital forces of the government it dispossessed, a
system without the breath of life, without elasticity, without the
capacity of self-direction, imposed bodily upon a foreign people,
without even the care of preparing a foundation, such seems to have
been the Mar√°tha government, containing within itself all that
was necessary to ensure a precarious, but while it lasted, an
oppressive existence.</p>

<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> <span class="marginnote">The Red Salt Scare,
1857.</span>Very soon after the outbreak of the mutinies in the
North-West of India in May 1857, an uneasy feeling began to prevail in
the Bombay Presidency, especially in Gujar√°t. The story of the
greased cartridges had been industriously repeated and found credulous
listeners in every village. A similar incident occurred in
Gujar√°t. A consignment of salt from the Ran of Kachh having been
carried in bags which had previously held red ochre (<i>sindur</i>) had
become discoloured. This was observed at S√°dra in the Mahi
K√°ntha as the salt was in transit to <span class="corr" id="xd25e36196" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span>, and a report
was at once spread that the salt had been defiled with cow&rsquo;s
blood. It was believed in Ahmed√°b√°d and throughout
Gujar√°t that this was a device of the British Government to
destroy the caste of the people as a preliminary to their forcible
conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Passing of the Pariah Dog.</span>About
the time that the cakes or <i>chap√°tis</i> were being circulated
throughout the North-West of India, a common pariah dog was passed from
village to village in the Panch Mah√°ls and eastern
Gujar√°t. It was never ascertained who first set the dog in
motion, but it came from the Central India frontier with a basket of
food which was given to the village dogs, and a similar supply with the
dog was forwarded to the next village. When pestilence or other
calamity threatens an Indian village, it is the custom to take a goat
or a buffalo to the boundary and drive it into the lands of the
adjoining village, in the hope that it will avert evil from the
community. A similar belief prevailed among the Jews. There is no
reason to suppose that this movement of the dog in Gujar√°t was a
signal of revolt or had any deeper political significance than a vague
feeling that troublous times were approaching. Still it was by many
regarded as an evil omen and created considerable alarm.<a class="noteref" id="n433.1src" href="#n433.1" name="n433.1src">1</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> <span class="marginnote">Gold
Hoarding.</span>Although Gujar√°t was apparently tranquil in the
hot season of 1857, those who were most familiar with native opinion
were aware of the existence of very serious discontent, and indications
of the storm which lowered on the horizon were not wanting. When
disturbances are impending natives invariably convert their savings
into gold, because gold is more portable and more easily concealed than
silver. A sudden and unusual demand for gold in the markets, especially
by the native troops, had been observed. This fall of the political
barometer should never be disregarded. It indicates the approach of a
storm with great certainty.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Seditious Native Press.</span>The native
press, which had been merely disloyal, now assumed an attitude of
decided hostility. Every paper contained the most exaggerated accounts
of the massacre of Europeans in the North-West Provinces, and absurd
rumours were circulated of the approach of a combined Russian and
Persian army, which, it was said, had reached Attok and would shortly
invade Hindust√°n. It is much to be regretted that the measures
which were found necessary in 1880 for the suppression of seditious
publications were not enforced in 1857. Had this been done much evil
would have been averted. The native mind would not have become familiar
with the spectacle of the British Government held up to the execration
and contempt of its subjects and the vilest motives attributed to every
public measure.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Maulvi Sar√°j-ud-din.</span>The
native press was not the only source of sedition. The fall of the
British Government was openly predicted in every masjid, and in
Ahmed√°b√°d a Maulvi named Sar√°j-ud-din became
especially prominent by preaching a <i>jeh√°d</i> in the
J√°ma Masjid to audiences of native officers and
<i>sav√°rs</i> of the Gujar√°t Horse and troops from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> Ahmed√°b√°d cantonment. The Maulvi
was expelled from Ahmed√°b√°d and found his way to Baroda,
where he was afterwards arrested; but the impunity he so long enjoyed
brought great discredit upon Government, for it was very naturally
supposed that a government which tamely submitted to be publicly
reviled was too weak to resent the indignity. Oriental races are so
accustomed to violent measures that they seldom appreciate moderation
or forbearance. The generation that had known and suffered from the
anarchy of the Peshwa had passed away. The seditious language of the
native press and the masjid was addressed to a population too ignorant
to understand the latent power of the British Government.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Apparent Weakness of British Rule.</span>In
1857 the immense continent of Hindust√°n was governed by what
appeared to the people to be a few Englishmen unsupported by troops,
for they knew that the native army was not to be depended on, and the
European troops were so few that they were only seen in the larger
military cantonments. It must have seemed an easy task to dispose of
such a handful of men, and it probably never occurred to those who took
part in the insurrection that the overthrow of the British Government
would involve more serious operations than the capture or murder of the
Europeans who governed the country so easily. They could not perceive
that England would never submit to a defeat, and that the handful of
men who ruled India were supported by the whole power of the nation.
The plotters had no very definite ideas for the future. The
Musalm√°ns regarded the subversion of a government of
K√°firs as a triumph of Isl√°m, and both Muslims and Hindus
looked forward to a period of anarchy during which they might indulge
that appetite for plunder which had been restrained for so many years.
The descendants of the feudal aristocracy of the Peshwa are an ignorant
and improvident race deeply involved in debt. They could not fail to
see that under the operation of our laws their estates were rapidly
passing into the possession of the more intelligent mercantile classes,
and they hoped to recover their position in the revolution that was
about to ensue.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Administrative Defects.</span>A great
change had taken place in the character of the administration. The
civilians of the school of Duncan, Malcolm, and Mountstuart
Elphinstone, though not deeply learned in the law, were accomplished
earnest men, sufficiently acquainted with the unalterable principles of
right and wrong to administer substantial justice to a simple people
who had not yet learnt the art of lying. The people asked for justice
rather than law. They were satisfied with the justice they obtained
from the able and upright men who ruled this country during the first
half of this century. The writings and official reports of the officers
of that period indicate a knowledge of native customs and feelings and
a sympathy with the people that is unknown in the present day, for
knowledge and sympathy cannot be acquired except by a long and familiar
residence amongst the people which is now becoming every year more
impossible. When the overland route rendered communication with England
more easy and frequent, a reaction set in against patriarchal
administration. Concubinage with native women, which had been common,
was now declared vulgar, if not immoral; and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> relations between Europeans and Natives soon
became less cordial than they had been during the early period of
British rule. About this time a considerable immigration of lawyers
appeared in India. <span class="marginnote">The Courts
Disliked.</span>These briefless gentlemen, envious of the official
monopoly of the Civil Service, raised an outcry that justice was being
administered by men who had not acquired that knowledge of law which
the formality of eating a certain number of dinners at the Temple was
supposed to guarantee. They worked the press so industriously to this
cry, that in the course of a few years they had succeeded in impressing
their views on the Court of Directors in London and on the less
intelligent members of the Civil Service in India.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Sadar Court was then presided over by a succession
of feeble old gentlemen who had not sufficient force of character to
resist this selfish agitation, and by way of refuting the charge of
ignorance of law devoted themselves to the study of those petty
technicalities which have so often brought the administration of
justice into contempt, and which the progress of law reform has not
even now removed from the law of England. In 1827, Mountstuart
Elphinstone had enacted a Civil and Criminal Code which was still the
substantive law of the land. It was simple and admirably suited to the
people, but justice was administered according to the spirit rather
than the letter of the law. A district officer would have incurred
severe censure if his decisions were found to be inequitable, however
they might have been supported by the letter of the law. The national
character for even-handed justice had made the English name respected
throughout India and far across the steppes of Central Asia. But the
demoralizing example of the Sadar Ad√°lat soon extended to the
lower grades of the service. The Civil Service was afflicted with the
foolishness which, we are told, precedes ruin. Its members diligently
searched their law-books for precedents and cases, and rejoiced
exceedingly if they could show their knowledge of law by reversing the
decision of a lower Court on some long-forgotten ruling of the Courts
of Westminster. The first effect of this evil was to fill the courts
with corrupt and unprincipled <i>vakils</i> who perverted the course of
justice by perjury, forgery, and fraud of every description. Litigation
increased enormously, no cause was too rotten, no claim too fraudulent
to deprive it of the chance of success. The grossest injustice was
committed in the name of the law, and though the Civil Service was
above all suspicion of corruption, the evil could hardly have been
greater if the Judges had been corrupt. This state of affairs gave rise
to great discontent, for the administration of justice fell almost
entirely into the hands of the <i>vakils</i>. When men quarrelled they
no longer said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat or I&rsquo;ll kill you,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay a <i>vakil</i> <abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 50 to ruin you,&rdquo; and too often this was no
mere idle threat.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The In√°m Commission.</span>The
operations of the In√°m Commission and of the Survey Department
were also a fruitful cause of alarm and discontent. Many of the estates
of the more influential J√°gh&iacute;rd√°rs had been
acquired by fraud or violence during the period of anarchy which
preceded the fall of the Peshwa. The Patels and Deshmukhs had also
appropriated large areas of lands and had made grants of villages to
temples and assignments of revenue to Br√°hmans, religious
mendicants, and dancing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.<br>
The In√°m Commission.</span> girls. The Peshwa had never
recognized these alienations as any limitation of his rights, for he
farmed his revenues, and so long as a large sum was paid into his
treasury by the farmers it was immaterial to him how much land was
alienated. But when the Survey Department revealed the fact that nearly
a fourth part of the fertile province of Gujar√°t was
unauthorizedly enjoyed by these parasites; and that in other districts
the proportion of alienations was nearly equally large, a due regard
for the public interests demanded that there should be an investigation
into the title on which the lands were held rent-free. It became the
duty of the In√°m Commission to make this inquiry, and though a
very small portion of land was resumed or rather assessed to the land
revenue and the rules for the continuation of cash allowances were
extremely liberal, they could hardly be expected to give satisfaction
to those who had so long enjoyed immunity from any share of the public
burdens. The Br√°hmans and the priesthood of every sect deeply
resented the scrutiny of the In√°m Commission and excited an
intensely fanatical spirit by representing the inquiry as a
sacrilegious attack on their religious endowments and a departure from
the principle of neutrality and toleration which had been the policy of
Government from a very early period.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Army Disloyal.</span>Notwithstanding
all these elements of danger there would probably have been no revolt
if the army had remained loyal. Fortunately the Bombay army was
composed of a great variety of races, Musalm√°ns of the Shia and
Sunni sects, Mar√°th√°s of the Dakhan and Konkan,
Parv√°ris, Pardeshis, and a few Jews and Christians. Little
community of sentiment could exist, in so heterogeneous a force, and to
this circumstance we may trace the failure of each mutinous outbreak in
the regiments of the Bombay army. Many of its regiments had, however,
recruited extensively in the North-West Provinces which were then the
centre of the political cyclone, and it was soon discovered that
seditious overtures were being made to them not only by their brethren
in the regiments which had already mutinied, but by discontented
persons of higher rank. <span class="marginnote">B√°iza
B√°i of Gw√°lior.</span>The most important of these was a
clever woman known as the B√°iza B√°i. She was the daughter
of a Dakhan Sard√°r named Sirji R√°o Gh√°tke, and had
been married in early life to His Highness Dowlat R√°o Sindia the
Mah√°r√°ja of Gw√°lior. On his death she had been
allowed to adopt Jankoji R√°o as heir to the <i>g√°di</i>,
and during his minority she had been appointed by the British
Government Regent of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e36338" title="Source: Gwalior">Gw√°lior</span> state. In this position the
B√°i had accumulated great wealth. She had deposited
&pound;370,000 (37 l√°khs of rupees) for safe custody in the
treasury at Benares, and it was known that she had other resources at
<span class="corr" id="xd25e36341" title="Source: Gwalior">Gw√°lior</span>. Her avarice and ambition were
insatiable. She sent emissaries to all the Mar√°tha chiefs and
Th√°kors in Western India calling on them to take up arms and
restore the empire of Shiv√°ji. She appealed to the troops,
urging them to emulate the deeds of their comrades in the Bengal army
who had already nearly exterminated the Europeans in the North-West,
and warned them that if they did not now strike in defence of their
religion they would shortly be converted to Christianity and made to
drink the blood of the sacred cow.</p>

P√°rsi Riot in Broach, June 1857.</span> of the city which were
strongly held by the mutinous regiments. Gujar√°t was still
tranquil. It is true there had been a riot in Broach originating in a
long-standing feud between the P√°rsis and Musalm√°ns of
that town, but it had no political significance and had been promptly
suppressed. The ringleaders were arrested, tried, and sentenced to be
hanged for the murder of a P√°rsi, but there is no reason to
suppose that this disturbance had any immediate connection with the
outbreak in the North-West. It was probably only a coincidence, but the
violence of the rioters was no doubt encouraged by the weakness of our
position in Gujar√°t, and the exaggerated rumours which reached
them of the massacre of our countrymen.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mutiny at Mhow, July 1857.</span>On July
1st, 1857, the 23rd Bengal Native Infantry and the 1st Bengal Cavalry
stationed at Mhow mutinied and murdered Colonel Platt, Captain Fagan,
Captain Harris, and a number of European subordinates of the Telegraph
Department. The troops of His Highness Holkar fraternized with the
mutineers, attacked the Residency, and after a desultory fight drove
out Colonel Durand the Resident, who took refuge in Bhop√°l with
the surviving Europeans of Indor. Information of the mutiny at Mhow
soon reached Ahmed√°b√°d, and treasonable negotiations were
at once opened for a simultaneous rising of the Gujar√°t Horse
and of the troops in the cantonment; but they could not agree to
combined operations. The Mar√°th√°s hoped for the
restoration of the dynasty of the Peshwa, while the Pardeshis looked
towards Dehli where their brethren were already in arms, without any
very definite comprehension of what they were fighting for, but with
some vague idea that they would establish a Musalm√°n
<i>R√°j</i> on the throne of the Great Mughal.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mutiny at Ahmed√°b√°d, July
1857.</span>On July 9th, 1857, seven <i>sav√°rs</i> of the
Gujar√°t Horse raised a green flag in their regimental lines in
Ahmed√°b√°d and attempted to seize the quarter guard in
which the ammunition was stored; but the guard made some slight show of
resistance, and finding the regiment did not join them the mutineers
left the lines in the direction of Sarkhej. They were followed by the
Adjutant, Lieutenant Pym, with twelve <i>sav√°rs</i>, and Captain
Taylor, the commandant, joined them soon after with three men of the
Koli Corps, whom he had met on the Dholka road. The
<i>sav√°rs</i> were overtaken near the village of T√°jpor,
and having taken up a strong position between three survey
boundary-marks opened fire on their officers and the Kolis, the
<i>sav√°rs</i> standing aloof. After many shots had been
exchanged without result, Captain Taylor advanced to parley, and while
endeavouring to reason with his men was shot through the body. The
Kolis now re-opened fire and having shot two of the
<i>sav√°rs</i> the rest laid down their arms. They were tried
under Act XIV. of 1857 and hanged. The <i>sav√°rs</i> who
followed Lieutenant Pym passively declined to act against their
comrades, and if the Kolis had not been present the mutineers would
have escaped. Captain Taylor&rsquo;s wound was severe; the bullet
passed through his body, but he eventually recovered. The execution of
the <i>sav√°rs</i> had a good effect on the troops, but it became
evident that a serious struggle was impending, and Lord Elphinstone,
who was then at the head of the Bombay Government, took all the
precautions that were possible under the circumstances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span></p>

1857&ndash;1859.</span> <span class="marginnote">Mr. Ashburner&rsquo;s
Force.</span>Mr. Ashburner, Assistant Magistrate of Kaira, was ordered
to raise a force of 200 Foot and 30 Horse for the protection of his
districts, and Husain Kh√°n Battangi, a Musalm√°n gentleman
of Ahmed√°b√°d, was authorized to enlist 2000 of the
dangerous classes. It was not expected that this
Ahmed√°b√°d force would add to our fighting strength, but
the employment of the rabble of Ahmed√°b√°d on good pay
kept them out of mischief till the crisis was passed. Mr.
Ashburner&rsquo;s small force was composed of <span class="corr" id="xd25e36406" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>,
Makr√°nis, and Kolis. They were a very useful body of men and
were afterwards drafted into the Kaira Police of which they formed the
nucleus. It was this force that suppressed the rising of the
Th√°kors on the Mahi, which will be described below.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Genl. Roberts.</span>General Roberts, a
very able soldier, commanded the Northern Division at this time. He
fully realized the critical position of affairs in Gujar√°t. He
was aware that the troops were on the verge of mutiny, that the
Th√°kors were sharpening their swords and enlisting men, and that
no relief could be expected till after the rains. But he was not the
man to despond or to shirk the responsibility now thrown upon him. He
proved equal to the occasion and met each emergency as it arose with
the calm determination of a brave man.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Rising at Amjera<span class="corr" id="xd25e36416" title="Not in source">.</span></span>When the troops at
Mhow mutinied, the R√°ja of Amjera took up arms and attacked
Captain Hutchinson the Political Agent of Bhop√°war. He fled and
was sheltered by the R√°ja of J√°bwa. At the same time
(July 1857) the Musalm√°n Kanungus or accountants and

Dohad, and threatened the Kaira district. Captain Buckle, the Political
Agent, Rewa K√°ntha, marched from Baroda with two guns under
Captain Sheppee, R. A., and two companies of the 8th Regiment Native
Infantry, to relieve Dohad, while Major Andrews, with a wing of the 7th
Regiment, two guns under Captain Saulez, R. A., and 100 Sabres of the
Gujar√°t Horse, marched on Th√°sra to support Mr. Ashburner
and act generally under his orders. On the approach of Captain
Buckle&rsquo;s force the insurgents abandoned the siege, and Captain
Hutchinson soon after re-established his authority in Bhop√°war
by the aid of the M√°lwa Bhil Corps which remained loyal. He
arrested the R√°ja of Amjera and hanged him.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mutinies at Abu and Erinpur, 1857.</span>On
the 5th August the Jodhpur Legion stationed at Abu mutinied. They made
a feeble attack on the barracks of H. M. 33rd Regiment and Captain
Hall&rsquo;s bungalow, into which they fired a volley of musketry, but
were repulsed, leaving one of their men on the ground badly wounded.
The fog was so dense that it was impossible to use firearms
effectively. Mr. Lawrence of the Civil Service was the only person
wounded. A party of the 17th Bombay Native Infantry who were on duty at
&Aacute;bu, were suspected of complicity with the Jodhpur Legion and
were disarmed. The head-quarters of the Legion mutinied at Erinpur on
the same day as the attack at &Aacute;bu; they made the Adjutant,
Lieutenant Conolly, prisoner and plundered the treasury. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span></p>

Regiment of Grenadiers and the 7th Native Infantry. The Grenadiers were
chiefly Pardeshis from Oudh, while the majority of the 7th Regiment
were Mar√°th√°s. As is often the case, an enmity sprang up
between the two regiments. One night Captain Muter of the 2nd
Grenadiers was visiting the guards as officer of the day. On
approaching the quarter guard of the 7th Regiment, the sentry demanded
the password which Captain Muter could not give. The sentry very
properly refused to let him pass. Captain Muter returned to his lines,
called out a party of Grenadiers, and made the sentry a prisoner. Next
morning General Roberts put Captain Muter under arrest and released the
sentry. This incident intensified the ill-feeling between the two
regiments, and prevented their combination when the Grenadiers mutinied
a few days later. It had been arranged that the two Native Regiments
and the Golandauz artillery should mutiny at the same time, but there
was mutual distrust between them, and the Native officers of the
artillery had stipulated that they should make a show of resistance in
order to let it appear that they had been overpowered by a superior
force. About midnight on the 14th September 1857 the Grenadiers turned
out and fell in on their parade ground armed and loaded. The guns were
also brought out and loaded on their own parade ground. A Native
officer of the Grenadiers was sent with a party to take possession of
the guns in accordance with the preconcerted agreement, but the
Subhed√°r of the Artillery threatened to fire on them, and the
Native officer expecting that the guns would be given up without
resistance, <span class="corr" id="xd25e36442" title="Source: tho ught">thought</span> he had been betrayed, and retreated
with his party, who threw away their arms as they ran across the parade
ground. The Grenadiers were under arms on the parade waiting for the
guns, when seeing the disorder in which the party was retreating from
the Artillery lines, they also were seized with a panic and broke up in
confusion. Then for the first time the Native officers reported to
Colonel Grimes that there had been a slight disturbance in the lines.
The mere accident that the Native officer detached to take the guns had
not been informed of the show of resistance he was to expect from the
Artillery, probably averted the massacre of every European in
Gujar√°t. Twenty-one loaded muskets were found on the parade
ground, and though the whole regiment was guilty it was decided to try
the owners of those muskets by court martial. They were sentenced to
death. As it was doubtful if the Native troops would permit the
execution it was considered prudent to await the arrival of the 89th
Regiment under Colonel Ferryman and Captain Hatch&rsquo;s battery of
Artillery. They had been landed at Gogha during the monsoon with great
difficulty, and were compelled to make a wide detour to the north owing
to the flooded state of the country. On their arrival the executions
were carried out; five of the mutineers were blown from guns, three
were shot with musketry, and the rest were hanged in the presence of
the whole of the troops. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441"

which won the respect of all who were present.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">R√°dhanpur Disloyal.</span>The
example thus made, together with the presence of the European troops in
Gujar√°t, restored our prestige and gave us time to attend to
affairs on our frontier. The whole country was in a very disturbed
state. On the fall of Delhi on September 28th, 1857, a treasonable
correspondence was found between the Naw√°b of R√°dhanpur
in Gujar√°t and the Emperor of Delhi, which deeply implicated the
Naw√°b. He and his ministers had forwarded
<i>nazr√°n√°s</i> of gold <i>mohars</i> to Delhi and asked
for orders from the Emperor, offering to attack the British cantonments
at Disa and Ahmed√°b√°d. The Naw√°b had been on the
most friendly terms with Captain Black the Political Agent, and had
been considered perfectly loyal. Preparations were made to depose him
for this treacherous conduct. We were then so strong in Gujar√°t
that his estate could have been seized without the least difficulty,
but he was considered too contemptible an enemy and his treason was
pardoned.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Arab Outbreak at Sunth.</span>Lieutenant
Alban, with a party of Gujar√°t Horse, was now sent to settle
affairs in Sunth, a petty state in the Rewa K√°ntha. Mustapha
Kh√°n, at the head of a turbulent body of Arabs, had made the
R√°ja a prisoner in his own palace with a view to extort arrears
of pay and other claims. Lieutenant Alban&rsquo;s orders were to disarm
the Arabs. After some negotiations Mustapha Kh√°n waited on
Lieutenant Alban. He was attended by the whole of his armed followers
with the matches of their matchlocks alight, thinking no doubt to
intimidate Lieutenant Alban. On entering the tent Lieutenant Alban
disarmed him, but imprudently placed his sword on the table. While they
were conversing Mustapha Kh√°n seized his sword and Lieutenant
Alban immediately shot him with a revolver. The Arabs who crowded round
the tent now opened fire on Alban and his men, but they were soon
overpowered. Mustapha Kh√°n, four Arabs, and one
<i>sav√°r</i> of the Gujar√°t Horse were killed.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disturbance in
Lun√°v√°&#7693;a.</span>Lieutenant Alban, with a party of
the 7th Native Infantry under Lieutenant Cunningham then proceeded to
P√°li. A few months before one Surajmal, a claimant of the
L&uacute;n√°v√°&#7693;a <i>g√°di</i>, had attacked
the R√°ja of L&uacute;n√°v√°&#7693;a, but was
repulsed with severe loss and had since been harboured in the village
of P√°li. On the approach of Alban&rsquo;s force, it was attacked
by Surajmal&rsquo;s R√°jputs and the village was accordingly
burnt. Order was then restored in the Panch Mah√°ls, and it was
not again disturbed till T√°tia Topi entered the
Mah√°ls.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Conspiracy at Disa.</span>In October 1857 a
conspiracy was discovered between the Th√°kor of Samda near Disa
and some Native officers of the 2nd Cavalry and 12th Regiment Native
Infantry to attack and plunder the camp at Disa and to murder the
officers; but the evidence was not very clear, and before the trial
could take place the amnesty had been published under which the
suspected men were released. The peace of Northern Gujar√°t was
much disturbed at this time by the Th√°kor of Rova, who plundered
the P√°lanpur and Sirohi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442"

Th√°kor of Mandeta was also in arms but was held in check by a
detachment of the 89th Regiment and a squadron of cavalry at Ahmednagar
near <span class="corr" id="xd25e36494" title="Source: Idar">&Iacute;dar</span>.<a class="noteref" id="n442.1src"
href="#n442.1" name="n442.1src">2</a> <span class="marginnote">Conspiracy at Baroda.</span>The two Th√°kors were
acting in concert with some influential conspirators at Baroda of whom
Malh√°r R√°o G√°ikw√°r <i>alias</i> D√°da
S√°heb was the chief. It was this man who afterwards became
G√°ikw√°r of Baroda and was deposed for the attempt to
murder Colonel Phayre by poison.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Want of Combination.</span>It is very
remarkable that the sepoy war did not produce one man who showed any
capacity for command. Every native regiment was in a state of mutiny
and a large proportion of the civil population was ripe for revolt. If
only one honest man had been found who could have secured the
confidence and support of his fellow-countrymen, the fertile province
of Gujar√°t would have been at his mercy; but amongst natives
conflicting interests and mutual distrust make combination most
difficult. In India a conspirator&rsquo;s first impulse is to betray
his associates lest they should anticipate him. The failure of every
mutinous outbreak in Gujar√°t was due to this moral defect. This
trait may be traced throughout the history of the war and should be
studied by those who advocate the independence of India, and the
capacity of the native for self-government. It is an apt illustration
of native inability to organize combined operations that the most
formidable conspiracy for the subversion of our power should have been
delayed till October 1857. By this time the arrival of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s 89th Regiment and a battery of European artillery at
Ahmed√°b√°d had rendered a successful revolt impossible.
The mutinies of the Gujar√°t Horse and Grenadiers had been
promptly suppressed and severely punished. The termination of the
monsoon had opened the ports and reinforcements were daily expected.
Had the outbreak occurred simultaneously with the mutiny of the
Gujar√°t Horse, the Artillery, and the Second Grenadiers,
Gujar√°t must have been lost for a time and every European would
have been murdered.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha Conspiracy.</span>For many
years Govindr√°o <i>alias</i> B√°pu G√°ikw√°r,
a half brother of His Highness the G√°ikw√°r, had resided
near the Sh√°hib√°g at Ahmed√°b√°d. He had been
deported from Baroda for intriguing against his brother and had been
treated as a political refugee. This man with Malh√°rr√°o,
another brother of His Highness the G√°ikw√°r, Bh√°u
S√°heb Paw√°r, and a Sard√°r who called himself the
Bhonsla R√°ja, also related to His Highness by marriage,
conceived the design to murder the Europeans in Baroda
Ahmed√°b√°d and Kaira and establish a government in the
name of the R√°ja of S√°t√°ra. To B√°pu
G√°ikw√°r was entrusted the task of tampering with the
troops in Ahmed√°b√°d, and frequent meetings of the Native
officers were held at his house every night. The Bhonsla R√°ja,
with a man named Jhaveri N√°lchand, was deputed to the Kaira
district to secure the aid of the Th√°kors of Umeta,
Bh√°darva, Kera, and D√°ima, and of the Patels of
&Aacute;nand and Part√°bpur. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443"

<p><span class="fwMargin"><br>
<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> <span class="marginnote">Mar√°tha
Conspiracy.</span>These landholders assured B√°pu of their
support and the Th√°kor of Umeta mounted some iron guns and put
his fort in a state of defence. An agent named Maganl√°l was sent
into the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s Kadi Pargana, where he enlisted
a body of 2000 foot and 150 horse, which he encamped near the village
of Lodra. The followers of the Kaira Th√°kors assembled in the
strong country on the banks of the Mahi near the village of
Part√°bpur with a detachment and advanced to the Chauk
Tal√°v within five miles of Baroda. The massacre at Baroda was
fixed for the night of October 16th. The native troops in Baroda had
been tampered with and had promised in the event of their being called
out that they would fire blank ammunition only.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gathering at Part√°bpur,</span>The
Th√°kors had been encamped at Part√°bpur for several days,
but owing partly to the sympathy of the people and partly to the terror
which they inspired, no report was made to any British officers till
the 15th October, when Mr. Ashburner, who was encamped at
Th√°sra, marched to attack them with his new levies and a party
of the Kaira police. There was, as usual, disunion in the ranks of the
insurgents; they had no leaders they could depend upon, and they
dispersed on hearing of the approach of Ashburner&rsquo;s force without
firing a shot. Ninety-nine men who had taken refuge in the ravines of
the Mahi were captured and a commission under Act XIV. of 1857 was
issued to Mr. Ashburner and Captain Buckle, the Political Agent in the
Rewa K√°ntha, to try them. Ten of the ringleaders were found
guilty of treason and blown from guns at Kanv√°ri, nine were
transported for life, and the remainder were pardoned. The turbulent
villages of Part√°bpur and Angar in Kaira were destroyed and the
inhabitants removed to more accessible ground in the open country.
Their strong position in the ravines of the Mahi river had on several
occasions enabled the people of <span class="corr" id="xd25e36538"
title="Source: Purt√°bpur">Part√°bpur</span> and Angar to
set Government at defiance, and this was considered a favourable
opportunity of making an example of them and breaking up their
stronghold.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">And at Lodra.</span>In the meantime
information of the gathering at Lodra had reached Major Agar, the
Superintendent of Police, Ahmed√°b√°d. He marched to attack
them with the Koli Corps and a squadron of the Gujar√°t Horse.
Maganl√°l fled to the north after a slight skirmish in which two
men were killed and four wounded, and was captured a few days
afterwards by the <i>Th√°nd√°r</i> of Sammu with eleven
followers. They were tried by General Roberts and Mr. Hadow, the
Collector of Ahmed√°b√°d, under Act XIV. of 1857. Three of
them were blown from guns at Waiz√°pur, three were hanged, and
the rest were transported for life.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that Malh√°rr√°o
G√°ikw√°r and the Bhonsla R√°ja were allowed to
escape punishment. There was very clear evidence of the guilt of the
Bhonsla R√°ja, but His Highness the G√°ikw√°r
interceded for him, and Sir Richmond Shakespeare, the Resident, weakly
consented that his life should be spared on condition that he should be
imprisoned for life at Baroda, a sentence which, it is hardly necessary
to say, was never carried out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444"

<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,
1857&ndash;1859.</span> <span class="marginnote">Partial
Disarming.</span>On the suppression of this abortive insurrection it
was determined to disarm Gujar√°t, and in January 1858 strong
detachments of the 72nd Highlanders and of Her Majesty&rsquo;s 86th
Regiment with the 8th Regiment Native Infantry, two guns under Captain
Conybere, and a squadron of Gujar√°t Horse were placed at the
disposal of Mr. Ashburner to carry out this measure. His Highness the
G√°ikw√°r had consented to a simultaneous disarmament of
his country, but he evaded the performance of his promise. In the Kaira
district and in the Jambusar t√°luka of Broach the disarmament
was very strictly enforced; every male adult of the fighting classes
was required to produce an arm of some kind. The town of
Ahmed√°b√°d was relieved of 20,000 arms in the first two
days, but the Highlanders and 86th Regiment were required for
operations in <span class="corr" id="xd25e36563" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span>, and after
their departure from Gujar√°t it was deemed prudent to postpone
this very unpopular measure.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">N√°ikda Revolt, Oct.
1858.</span>After these events Gujar√°t remained tranquil for
nearly a year till, in October 1858, the N√°ikda Bhils of
N√°rukot revolted under Rupa and Keval N√°iks, and a few
months later T√°tia Topi&rsquo;s scattered force being
hard-pressed by Colonel Park&rsquo;s column, plundered several villages
of the Panch Mah√°ls during its rapid march through that
district.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">T√°tia Topi, 1858.</span>In 1858,
after his defeat at Gw√°lior, at the close of the mutinies in
Northern India, T√°tia Topi moved rapidly towards the Dakhan. The
chiefs of Jamkhandi and N√°rgund had been in treasonable
correspondence with the rebel chiefs in the North-West and had invoked
their aid. It is more than probable that if T√°tia Topi had
entered the Dakhan in force, there would have been a general
insurrection of the Mar√°tha population. T√°tia&rsquo;s
march to the Dakhan soon assumed the character of a flight. He was
closely pressed by two columns under Generals Somerset and Mitchell,
and a very compact and enterprizing little field force commanded by
Colonel Park. Colonel Park&rsquo;s own regiment, the 72nd Highlanders,
many of the men mounted on camels, formed the main fighting power of
this force. His indefatigable energy in the pursuit of the enemy
allowed them no rest, and eventually brought them to bay at Chhota
Udepur. Fearing to face the open country of Ber√°r with such an
uncompromising enemy in pursuit, T√°tia recrossed the Narbada at
Chikalda and marched towards Baroda. He had, by means of an agent named
Ganpatr√°o, for some time been in communication with the
Bh√°u S√°heb Pav√°r, a brother-in-law of His Highness
the G√°ikw√°r, and had been led to expect aid from the
Baroda Sard√°rs and the Th√°kors of the Kaira and Rewa
K√°ntha districts. Immediately it became known that T√°tia
had crossed the Narbada, troops were put in motion from Kaira,
Ahmed√°b√°d, and Disa for the protection of the eastern
frontier of Gujar√°t. Captain Thatcher, who had succeeded to the
command of the irregular levies raised by Mr. Ashburner in Kaira, was
ordered to hold Sankheda with the irregulars and two of the
G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s guns. He was afterwards reinforced by
Captain Collier&rsquo;s detachment of the 7th Regiment N. I., which
fell back from Chhota Udepur on the approach of the enemy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span></p>

Topi&rsquo;s Defeat at Chhota Udepur, Dec. 1858.</span>T√°tia
Topi at this time commanded a formidable force composed of fragments of
many mutinous Bengal regiments. He had also been joined by a mixed
rabble of Vill√°yatis, Rohill√°s, and R√°jputs, who
followed his fortune in hopes of plunder. Ferozsha Naw√°b of
Kamona and a Mar√°tha Sard√°r who was known as the
R√°o S√°heb, held subordinate commands. Each fighting man
was followed by one or more ponies laden with plunder which greatly
impeded their movements. It was chiefly owing to this that Colonel Park
was enabled to overtake the rebels and to force them into action. On
reaching Chhota Udepur the troops of the R√°ja fraternised with
the enemy, and Captain Collier having evacuated the town, T√°tia
Topi was allowed to occupy it without opposition. He had intended to
halt at Chhota Udepur to recruit his men and to develop his intrigues
with the Baroda Sard√°rs, but Park gave him no respite. On the
1st December 1858, he fell upon T√°tia&rsquo;s rebel force and
defeated it with great slaughter, his own loss being trifling. After
this defeat there was great confusion in the ranks of the insurgents.
T√°tia Topi abandoned his army and did not rejoin it till it had
reached the forest lands of P√°rona. Discipline which had always
been lax, was now entirely thrown aside. The muster roll of one of
T√°tia&rsquo;s cavalry regiments was picked up and showed that
out of a strength of 300 sabres only sixteen were present for duty. The
rebel force separated into two bodies, one doubled back and plundered
Park&rsquo;s baggage which had fallen far to the rear, the other under
Ferozsha entered the Panch Mah√°ls and looted B√°riya,
Jh√°lod, <span class="corr" id="xd25e36590" title="Source: Lim&#7693;i">Limb&#7693;i</span>, and other villages; Godhra
being covered by Muter&rsquo;s force was not attacked. Park&rsquo;s
force was so disabled by the plunder of its baggage and by long
continued forced marches, that it was compelled to halt at Chhota
Udepur, but General Somerset took up the pursuit and rapidly drove
T√°tia from the Panch Mah√°ls. He fled in the direction of
Salumba. The Th√°kor of that place was in arms, and T√°tia
no doubt expected support from him, but the Th√°kor was too
cautious to join what was then evidently a hopeless cause. On reaching
Nargad on the 20th February 1859, Ferozsha made overtures of surrender,
and a week later 300 cavalry and a mixed force of 1500 men under Zahur
Ali and the Maulvi Vazir Kh√°n laid down their arms to General
Mitchell. They were admitted to the benefit of the amnesty. The remnant
of T√°tia&rsquo;s force fled to the north-east.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">N√°ikda Disturbance, 1858.</span>In
October 1858, instigated by the intrigues of the Bh√°u
S√°heb Pav√°r, the Sankheda N√°ikd√°s, a very
wild forest tribe, took up arms under Rupa and Keval N√°iks, and
after having plundered the outpost, <i>th√°na</i>, at
N√°rukot, attacked a detachment of the 8th Regiment N. I. under
Captain Bates at J√°mbughoda. They were repulsed with
considerable loss after a desultory fight during the greater part of
two days. On the arrest of Ganpatr√°o, the Bh√°u
S√°heb&rsquo;s agent, this troublesome insurrection would
probably have collapsed, but the Naikd√°s were joined by a number
of Vill√°yatis, matchlock-men, the fragments of
T√°tia&rsquo;s broken force, who encouraged them to hold out.
They occupied the very strong country between Ch√°mp√°ner
and N√°rukot, and kept up a harassing warfare, plundering the
villages as far north as Godhra. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446"

N√°ikda Disturbance, 1858.</span> A field force commanded by the
Political Agent of the Rewa K√°ntha, Colonel Wallace, was
employed against the N√°ikd√°s during the cold weather of
1858, and in one of the frequent skirmishes with the insurgents Captain
Hayward of the 17th Regiment N. I. was severely wounded by a matchlock
bullet on the 28th January 1859. The only success obtained by the
N√°ikd√°s was the surprise of Hassan Ali&rsquo;s company of
Hussein Kh√°n&rsquo;s levy. The Subhed√°r had been ordered
to protect the labourers who were employed in opening the pass near the
village of Sivr√°jpur, but the duty was very distasteful to him,
and his son deserted with twenty-four men on the march to
Sivr√°jpur. They were suddenly attacked by a mixed force of
Makr√°nis and N√°ikd√°s. Seven men including the
Subhed√°r were killed and eleven wounded without any loss to the
enemy. The Subhed√°r neglected to protect his camp by the most
ordinary precautions and his men appear to have behaved badly. They
fled without firing a shot directly they were attacked. But little
progress had been made in pacifying the N√°ikd√°s till
Captain Richard Bonner was employed to raise and organize a corps
composed chiefly of Bhils with their head-quarters at Dohad in the
Panch Mah√°ls. Captain Bonner&rsquo;s untiring energy and moral
influence soon reduced the N√°ikd√°s to submission. Rupa
N√°ik laid down his arms and accepted the amnesty of the 10th
March 1859, and Keval N√°ik followed his example soon after.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">W√°gher Outbreak, 1859.</span>In July
1859 the W√°ghers of Okh√°mandal, a mah√°l in
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a belonging to His Highness the
G√°ikw√°r, suddenly seized and plundered Dw√°rka,
Barv√°la, and Bet. They were led by a W√°gher chief named
Toda Manik, who alleged that he had been compelled to take up arms by
the oppression of the G√°ikw√°r&rsquo;s
<i>k√°md√°rs</i>; but it is probable that he was encouraged
to throw off allegiance by the weakness of the Baroda administration
and the belief that he would have to deal with the troops of the
Darb√°r only. He soon found he was in error. Major Christie with
200 sabres of the Gujar√°t Horse and a wing of the 17th Regiment
Native Infantry from R√°jkot marched to Mand√°na on the Ran
to cut off the communication between Okh√°mandal and the
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a peninsula. The cantonment of
R√°jkot was reinforced from Ahmed√°b√°d by six guns
of Aytoun&rsquo;s battery, a wing of the 33rd Regiment and a detachment
of the 14th Regiment Native Infantry under Captain Hall, and a naval
and military force was at the same time prepared in Bombay for the
recovery of Bet and Dw√°rka as soon as the close of the monsoon
should render naval operations on the western coast possible.</p>

Field Battery and detachments of the 14th Native Infantry and
Gujar√°t Horse. Had Colonel Donovan waited for this force he
might have effectually invested the fort of Bet, which is situated on
an island, and exterminated the rebels; but he was too anxious to
distinguish himself before he could be relieved of command. He arrived
off Bet on the 4th October 1859, and at sunrise that morning the
steam-ships <i>Firoz</i>, <i>Zenobia</i>, <i>Clyde</i>, and
<i>Constance</i> took up their positions off the fort of Bet and opened
fire with shot and shell at 950 yards. The fort replied feebly with a
few small guns. Shells effectually scorched the fort and temples
occupied by the enemy, but the shot made little impression on the wall
which was here thirty feet thick. The bombardment continued throughout
the day and at intervals during the night. Next morning Dewa Chabasni,
the W√°gher chief in command of the fort, opened negotiations for
surrender, but he would not consent to the unconditional surrender
which was demanded, and after an interval of half an hour the artillery
fire was resumed and preparations were made to disembark the troops.
They landed under a heavy musketry fire from the fort and adjacent
buildings, and an attempt was made to escalade. The ladders were placed
against the wall but the storming party of Her Majesty&rsquo;s 28th
Regiment and 6th Regiment Native Infantry were repulsed with heavy
loss. Captain McCormack of Her Majesty&rsquo;s 28th Regiment, Ensign
Willaume of the 6th Regiment, and ten European soldiers were killed;
and Captain Glasspoole, Lieutenant Grant of the 6th Native Infantry,
and thirty-seven men of the 28th Regiment were wounded, many of them
severely. One sepoy of the Marine Battalion was killed and five
wounded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Bet Fort Taken.</span>During the night
which succeeded this disastrous attack the W√°ghers evacuated the
fort. They reached the mainland, taking with them their women the
children and the plunder of the temple, but Dewa Chabasni, the
W√°gher chief, had been killed the previous day. Considering the
large and well-equipped force at Colonel Donovan&rsquo;s disposal and
the facilities which the insular position of Bet afforded to a
blockading force, the escape of the W√°ghers almost with
impunity, encumbered with women and plunder, did not enhance Colonel
Donovan&rsquo;s military reputation. Captain D. Nasmyth, R. E., Field
Engineer of the Okh√°mandal Force, was directed to destroy the
fort of Bet and carried out his instructions most effectually. Some of
the Hindu temples nearest the walls were severely shaken by the
explosion of the mines, and a great outcry was raised of the
desecration of the temples; but if Hindus will convert their temples
into fortified enclosures, they must take the consequence when they are
occupied by the enemies of the British Government.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Charles Goodfellow, R. E., greatly distinguished himself
on this occasion. He earned the Victoria Cross by carrying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>

<span class="sc">Gujar√°t Disturbances</span>,

Regiment under a very heavy fire. Treasure valued at 3&frac12;
l√°khs of rupees was taken on board the <i>Firoz</i> for safe
custody. It was eventually restored to the Puj√°ris of the
temples, but most of the temples had been carefully plundered by the
W√°ghers before the entry of the British force.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><span class="corr" id="xd25e36740" title="Source: Dwarka">Dw√°rka</span> Fort Taken.</span>Many of the
fugitives from Bet took refuge in Dw√°rka, and Colonel
Donovan&rsquo;s force having re-embarked proceeded to Dw√°rka to
await the arrival of Colonel Scobie&rsquo;s small brigade.
Scobie&rsquo;s force did not reach Dw√°rka till October 20th. The
Naval Brigade under Lieutenant Sedley with sixteen officers and 110 men
had already landed under very heavy matchlock fire, and thrown up a
slight breastwork of loose stone within 150 yards of the walls. A field
piece from the <i>Zenobia</i> and afterwards a thirty-two pounder were
placed in position in this work. The successful result of the siege was
mainly due to the determined bravery of this small naval force. They
repulsed repeated sorties from the fort and inflicted severe losses on
the enemy. As soon as the stores and ammunition could be landed,
Colonel Donovan took up a position to the north-east of the fort,
Colonel Scobie to the south-east, and Captain Hall occupied an
intermediate position with detachments of Her Majesty&rsquo;s 33rd
Regiment, the 14th Native Infantry, and Gujar√°t Horse under
Lieutenant Pym. The garrison made several determined attempts to break
through Captain Hall&rsquo;s position, but they were on each occasion
driven back with loss.</p>
<p>The first battery opened fire on the northern face of the fort on
October 28th, while the <i>Zenobia</i> and the <i>Firoz</i> poured a
well-directed fire of shells on the houses and temples which sheltered
the enemy towards the sea. The shells did immense execution and
relieved the attack on the Naval Brigade which continued to hold its
position with the greatest gallantry though several times surrounded by
the enemy. On the night of the 31st October the garrison evacuated the
fort and cut its way through a picket of Her Majesty&rsquo;s 28th
Regiment, wounding Ensign Hunter and four men. A detachment under
Colonel Christie followed the fugitives next morning and overtook them
near Vasatri. A skirmish ensued, but they escaped without much loss and
took refuge in the Barda hill. They continued to disturb the peace of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e36755" title="Source: K√°thi√°va&#7693;a">K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a</span>
for several years. In one of the desultory skirmishes which followed,
Lieutenants LaTouche and Hebbert were killed.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Rising in Nagar P√°rkar.</span>While
these events were in progress, Karranji Hati the R√°na of Nagar
P√°rkar on the Sindh frontier of Gujar√°t, took up arms at
the head of a band of Sodh√°s, plundered the treasury and
telegraph office at Nagar P√°rkar, and released the prisoners in
the jail. Colonel Evans commanded the field force which was employed
against him for many months without any very definite results. The
country is a desert and the Sodh√°s avoided a collision with the
troops. The R√°na eventually submitted and peace was restored.

href="#n433.1src" name="n433.1">1</a></span> The rite of passing cakes
from village to village or of passing a dog from village to village is
in such complete accord with magical and religious rites practised all
over India that it seems hardly possible to accept either as
meaningless or as accidental the passing of cakes and of a dog from one
part of the country to another on the brink of the Mutinies. Knowing
how suitable such a rite is to the state of feeling as well as to the
phase of belief prevalent among the plotters of rebellion in Northern
India it seems difficult to suppose that the passing of the cakes and
the passing of the dog were not both sacramental; that is designed to
spread over the country a spirit which had by religious or magical
rites been housed in the dog and in the cakes. The cake-spirit, like
the sugar-spirit of the Thags, was doubtless K√°li, the fierce
longing for unbridled cruelty, which worked on the partaker of the Thag
sugar with such power that he entered with zest and without remorse on
any scheme however cowardly and cruel. Like the Thags those who ate the
Mutiny cakes would by partaking become of one spirit, the spirit of the
indwelling K√°li, and, in that spirit would be ready to support
and to take part in any scheme of blood which the leaders of Mutiny
might devise and start. Similarly by religious rites the Central India
dog, possibly the dog of B√°iza B√°i of <span class="corr"
id="xd25e36209" title="Source: Gwalior">Gw√°lior</span> (See Text
page <a href="#pb437" class="pageref">437</a>), had been made the home
of some fierce war-spirit, apparently of the dog-formed Khandoba the
Mar√°tha Sword God and Dog of War. The inspired dog and the
inspired dogs-meat were passed through the land in the confidence that
through them the spirit of unrest would pervade every village of
Gujar√°t. Since the Mutinies, by the magic of letters,
K√°li has passed from the wafer into the leaflet, and the paid
political propagandist has taken the place of Khandoba&rsquo;s pariah
dog.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The correctness of the view suggested above is
supported if not established by certain passages in Kaye&rsquo;s Sepoy
War, I. 632&ndash;642. Chuni says; &lsquo;The circulating of cakes was
supposed to foretell disturbance and to imply an invitation to the
people to unite for some secret purpose.&rsquo; According to the king
of Delhi&rsquo;s physician (page 636) some charm attached to the cakes.
The people thought they were made by some adept in the secret arts to
keep unpolluted the religion of the country. Another authority (page
637) says; &lsquo;The first circulation of the cakes was on the
authority of a pandit who said the people would rise in rebellion if
cakes were sent round and that the person in whose name the cakes were
sent would rule India.&rsquo; The secret comes out in <span class="corr" id="xd25e36219" title="Source: Sitar√°m">Sit√°r√°m</span>
B√°w√°&rsquo;s evidence (pages 646&ndash;648); &lsquo;The
cakes in question were a charm or <i>j√°du</i> which originated
with D√°sa B√°wa the <i>guru</i> or teacher of N√°na
S√°heb. D√°sa told N√°na S√°heb he would make a
charm and as far as the magic cakes should be carried so far should the
people be on his side. He then took lotusseed-dough called
<i>mak√°na</i> and made an idol of it. He reduced the idol to
very small pills and having made an immense number of cakes he put a
pillet in each and said that as far as the cakes were carried so far
would the people determine to throw off the Company&rsquo;s
yoke.&rsquo; With this making of a cake as a sacramental home of Durga
or K√°li compare the Buddhist of Tibet offering in a human skull
to the M√°h√°r√°ni or Queen, that is to Durga or
K√°li, a sacramental cake made of black-goat&rsquo;s fat, wine,
dough, and butter. (Waddell&rsquo;s Buddhism in Tibet, 365.). As to the
effect of sharing in Durga&rsquo;s mutiny cakes compare the statement
of the Thag Faringia (Sleeman&rsquo;s Ramaseeana, page 216); The sugar
sacrament, <i>gur-tap√°vani</i>, changes our nature. Let a man
once taste the sacramental sugar and he will remain a Thag however
skilful a craftsman, however well-to-do. The Urdu proverb says
<i>Tapauni-ki-dhaunika gur jisne kh√°y√° wuh wais√°
hu√°</i> Who eats the sugar of the sacramental Vase as he is so
he remains. The Thags are tools in the hand of the god they have eaten.

24&deg; 42&prime; East Longitude 72&deg; 4&prime;, the historical
Shrim√°l, the capital of the Gurjjaras from about the sixth to
the ninth century, lies about fifty miles west of &Aacute;bu hill. The
site of the city is in a wide plain about fifteen miles west of the
last outlier of the &Aacute;bu range. To the east, between the hills
and Bhinm√°l, except a few widely-separated village sites, the
plain is chiefly a grazing ground with brakes of thorn and cassia
bushes overtopped by standards of the camel-loved <i>pilu</i> Salvadora
persica. To the south, the west, and the north the plain is smooth and
bare passing westwards into sand. From the level of the plain stand out
a few isolated blocks of hill, 500 to 800 feet high, of which one peak,
about a mile west of the city, is crowned by the shrine of
Ch√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a the &#346;r&iacute; or Luck of
Bhinm√°l. From a distance the present Bhinm√°l shows few
traces of being the site of an ancient capital. Its 1500 houses cover
the gentle slope of an artificial mound, the level of their roofs
broken by the spires of four Jain temples and by the ruined state
office at the south end of the mound. Closer at hand the number and
size of the old stone-stripped tank and fortification mounds and the
large areas honeycombed by diggers for bricks show that the site of the
present Bhinm√°l was once the centre of a great and widespread
city. Of its fortifications, which, as late as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1611, the English merchant Nicholas Ufflet, in a
journey from Jh√°lor to Ahmed√°b√°d, describes as
enclosing a circuit of thirty-six miles (24 <i>kos</i>) containing many
fine tanks going to ruin, almost no trace remains.<a class="noteref"
id="n449.2src" href="#n449.2" name="n449.2src">2</a> The names of some
of the old gates are remembered, Surya in the north-east,
&#346;r&iacute; Lakshm&iacute; in the south-east, Sanchor in the west,
and Jh√°lor in the north. Sites are pointed out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>

Description.</span> as old gateways five to six miles to the east and
south-east of the present town, and, though their distance and
isolation make it hard to believe that these ruined mounds were more
than outworks, Ufflet&rsquo;s testimony seems to establish the
correctness of the local memory.<a class="noteref" id="n450.1src" href="#n450.1" name="n450.1src">3</a> Besides these outlying gateways traces
remain round the foot of the present Bhinm√°l mound of a smaller
and later wall. To the east and south the line of fortification has
been so cleared of masonry and is so confused with the lines of tank
banks, which perhaps were worked into the scheme of defence, that all
accurate local knowledge of their position has passed. The
Gujar√°t gate in the south of the town though ruined is well
marked. From the Gujar√°t gateway a line of mounds may be traced
south and then west to the ruins of Pipalduara perhaps the western
gateway. The wall seems then to have turned east crossing the
watercourse and passing inside that is along the east bank of the
watercourse north to the south-west corner of the Jaikop or Yaksha
lake. From this corner it ran east along the south bank of Jaikop to
the Jh√°lor or north gate which still remains in fair
preservation its pointed arch showing it to be of Musalm√°n or
late (17th&ndash;18th century) R√°htor construction. From the
Jh√°lor gate the foundations of the wall may be traced east to
the Kanaksen or Kar√°da tank. The area to the east of the town
from the Kar√°da tank to the Gujar√°t gate has been so
quarried for brick to build the present Bhinm√°l that no sign
remains of a line of fortifications running from the Kar√°da tank
in the east to the Gujar√°t gate in the south.</p>
<p>The site of the present town the probable centre of the old city, is
a mound stretching for about three-quarters of a mile north and south
and swelling twenty to thirty feet out of the plain. On almost all
sides its outskirts are protected by well made thorn fences enclosing
either garden land or the pens and folds of Rab√°ris and
Bh&iacute;ls. The streets are narrow and winding. The dwellings are of
three classes, the flat mud-roofed houses of the Mah√°jans or
traders and of the better-to-do Br√°hmans and craftsmen with
canopied doors and fronts plastered with white clay: Second the tiled
sloping-roofed sheds of the bulk of the craftsmen and gardeners and of
the better-off Rab√°ris and Bh&iacute;ls: and Third the thatched
bee-hive huts of the bulk of the Rab√°ris and Bh&iacute;ls and of
some of the poorer craftsmen and husbandmen. Especially to the
north-west and west the houses are skirted by a broad belt of garden
land. In other parts patches of watered crops are separated by the bare
banks of old tanks or by stretches of plain covered with thorn and
cassia bushes or roughened by the heaps of old buildings honeycombed by
shafts sunk by searchers for bricks. Besides the four spired temples to
P√°rasn√°th the only outstanding building is the old
<i>kacheri</i> or state office a mass of ruins which tops the steep
south end of the city mound.</p>

<i>In the Town.</i></span>Inside of the town the objects of interest
are few. The four temples of P√°rasn√°th are either modern
or altered by modern repairs. A rest-house to the south of a temple of
Bar√°gi or Var√°ha the Boar in the east of the town has
white marble pillars with inscriptions of the eleventh and thirteenth
centuries which show that the pillars have been brought from the ruined
temple of the sun or Jag Sv√°mi Lord of the World on the mound
about eighty yards east of the south or modern Gujar√°t gate. In
the west of the town, close to the wall of the enclosure of the old
Mah√°lakshmi temple, is a portion of a white marble pillar with
an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name="pb452">452</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

1342 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1286) which apparently has been
brought from the same ruined sun temple. In the <i>kacheri</i> ruins at
the south end of the mound the only object of interest is a small
shrine to M√°ta with two snakes supporting her seat and above in
modern characters the words N√°g√°ne the <i>kuldevi</i> or
tribe guardian of the R√°htors.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Surroundings.</i></span>The chief object
of interest at Bhinm√°l is the ruined temple of the Sun on a
mound close to the south of the town. Of this temple and its
inscriptions details are given below. About fifty yards west of the Sun
temple are the remains of a gateway known as the Gujar√°t
gateway. This modern name and the presence near it of blocks of the
white quartz-marble of the Sun temple make it probable that the gateway
is not older than Musalm√°n or eighteenth century R√°htor
times. Close to the west of the gate is Kh√°ri B√°va the
Salt Well an old step and water-bag well with many old stones mixed
with brick work. About a hundred yards south of the Gujar√°t
gate, in a brick-walled enclosure about sixteen yards by eight and nine
feet high topped by a shield parapet, is the shrine of Mah√°deva
Naul√°kheshwar. An inscription dated <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1800 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1744)
states that the enclosure marks the site of an old temple to
Naul√°kheshwar. About fifty yards east of the
Naul√°kheshwar shrine is a large brick enclosure about
seventy-five yards square with walls about twelve feet high and a
pointed-arched gateway in the Moslim wave-edged style. On entering, to
the left, is a plinth with a large Hanum√°n and further to the
left in domed shrines are a Ganpati and a M√°ta. A few paces
south is Brahma&rsquo;s Pool or Brahmakhund with steep steps on the
west and north, a rough stone and brick wall to the east, and a
circular well to the south. The pool walls and steps have been repaired
by stones taken from Hindu temples or from former decorations of the
pool on some of which are old figures of Mat√°s in good repair.
The story is that Som, according to one account the builder of the Sun
temple according to another account a restorer of Shrim√°l,
wandering in search of a cure for leprosy, came to the south gate of
Shrim√°l. Som&rsquo;s dog which was suffering from mange
disappeared and soon after appeared sound and clean. The king traced
the dog&rsquo;s footmarks to the Brahmakhund, bathed in it, and was
cured. As a thank-offering he surrounded the pool with masonry walls.
To the south of the pool, to the right, are an underground
<i>lin&#775;g</i> sacred to Pat√°leshwar the lord of the Under
World and south of the <i>lin&#775;g</i> a small domed shrine of Chandi
Devi. To the left, at the east side of a small brick enclosure is a
snake-canopied <i>lin&#775;g</i> known as Chandeshwar hung about with
strings of <i>rudr√°ksh</i> <span lang="la">El&aelig;ocarpus
ganitrus</span> beads.<a class="noteref" id="n452.1src" href="#n452.1"
name="n452.1src">9</a> In front of Chandeshwar&rsquo;s shrine is a
small inscribed stone with at its top a cow and calf recording a land
grant to Shrim√°li Br√°hmans. About forty yards north-east
of the Brahmakhund a large straggling heap of brick and earth, now
known as Laksham&iacute;thala or Lakshm&iacute;&rsquo;s settlement, is
said to be the site of a temple to Lakshm&iacute; built, according to
the local <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<i>Surroundings.</i></span> legend, by a Br√°hman to whom in
return for his devotedness Lakshm&iacute; had given great wealth. The
hollow to the south-east is known as the Khand√°lia pool. About
fifty yards south-east at the end of a small enclosure is a shrine and
cistern of Jageshwar, said to be called after a certain Jag who in
return for the gift of a son built the temple. Several old carved and
dressed stones are built into the walls of this temple. About
seventy-five yards further south-east a large area rough with heaps of
brick is said to be the site of an old Vidhya-S√°la or Sanskrit
College. This college is mentioned in the local Mah√°tmya as a
famous place of learning the resort of scholars from distant
lands.<a class="noteref" id="n453.1src" href="#n453.1" name="n453.1src">10</a> The local account states that as the Bhils grew too
powerful the Br√°hmans were unable to live in the college and
retired to Dholka in north Gujar√°t.</p>
<p>The slope and skirts of the town beyond the thorn-fenced enclosures
of Bhils and Rab√°ris lie in heaps honeycombed with holes
hollowed by searchers for bricks. Beyond this fringe of fenced
enclosures from a half to a whole mile from the city are the bare white
banks of pools and tanks some for size worthy to be called lakes. Of
these, working from the south northwards, the three chief are the
Nimb√°li or Narmukhsarovar, the Goni or Gayakund, and the Talbi
or Trambaksarovar. The Nimb√°li tank, about 300 yards south-east
of the college site, is a large area opening eastwards whence it draws
its supply of water and enclosed with high bare banks scattered with
bricks along the south-west and north. The lake is said to be named
<span class="corr" id="xd25e37051" title="Source: Nimbali">Nimb√°li</span> after a V√°ni to whom
Mah√°deva granted a son and for whom Mah√°deva formed the
hollow of the lake by ploughing it with his thunderbolt. About half a
mile north-east of Nimb√°li a horseshoe bank fifteen to thirty
feet high, except to the open east, is the remains of the Goni lake.
Lines of stone along the foot of the north-west and north-east banks
shew that portions at least of these sides were once lined with
masonry. A trace of steps remains at a place known as the Gau
Gh√°t or Cowgate. The lake is said to have been named Goni after
a Br√°hman whose parents being eaten by a R√°kshas went to

merit or cleansing virtue of the water of G√°ya. In the
foreground a row of small <i>chatris</i> or pavilions marks the burying
ground of the Mahajan or high Hindu community of Bhinm√°l. Behind
the pavilions are the bare banks of the Talbi lake. At the west end is
the Bomb√°ro well and near the south-west is the shrine of
Tr&iacute;mbakeshvar Mah√°dev. This lake is said to have been
made in connection with a great sacrifice or <i>yag</i>, that is
<i>yajna</i>, held by Br√°hmans to induce or to compel the god
Trimbakeshwar to slay the demon Tripur√°sur. Beginning close to
the south of Talbi lake and stretching north-west towards the city is
the Kar√°d√° Sarovar or Kar√°d√° lake said to
have been built by Kanaksen or Kanishka the great founder of the
Skythian era (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;78). On the western

<i>Surroundings.</i></span> lake, which stretches close to the fenced
enclosures round the city, are the remains of a modern bastion and of a
wall which runs north-west to the Jh√°lor gate. Beyond the site
of the bastion is an enclosure and shrine of Maheshwar Mah√°dev.
To the north and north-west of the Karait sea lie four large tanks. Of
these the most eastern, about 300 yards north-west of
Kar√°d√°, is Brahmasarovar a large area fed from the north
and with high broken banks. Next, about 500 yards north-west, lies the
far-stretching V√°nkund or Forest Pool open to the north-east.
About 800 yards west is Gautam&rsquo;s tank which holds water
throughout the year. The banks of brick and <i>kankar</i> form nearly a
complete circle except at the feeding channels in the east and south.
In the centre of the lake is an islet on which are the white-stone
foundations (18&prime; &times; 12&prime;) of Gautam&rsquo;s hermitage.
On the bank above the east feeding-channel is an image of
Hanum√°n and on the east side of the southern channel at the foot
of the bank is a white inscribed stone with letters so worn that
nothing but the date <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1106
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1049) has been made out. Of the
balls of <i>kankar</i> or nodular limestone which are piled into the
bank of the tank those which are pierced with holes are lucky and are
kept to guard wooden partitions against the attacks of insects. The
last and westmost of the north row of tanks is the Jaikop properly
Jakshkop that is the Yaksha&rsquo;s Pool about 600 yards south-west of
the Gautam tank and close to the north-west of the town.<a class="noteref" id="n454.1src" href="#n454.1" name="n454.1src">12</a> This
tank holds water throughout the year and supplies most of the
town&rsquo;s demand. Along the south bank of the Jaikop, where are
tombs<span class="corr" id="xd25e37114" title="Not in source">,</span>
a shrine to Bhairav and a ruined mosque, the line of the later city
walls used to run. At the south-east corner of the tank are three
square masonry plinths each with a headstone carved with the figure of
a man or woman. One of the plinths which is adorned with a pillared
canopy has a stone carved with a man on horseback and a standing woman
in memory of a Tehsildar of Bhinm√°l of recent date (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1869; <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1812)
whose wife became <i>Sati</i>. About 200 yards south-east is a row of
white <i>p√°lia</i> or memorial slabs of which the third from the
south end of the row is dated <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1245
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1186). On the south-east bank is the
shrine of Nimghoria Bhairav at which Shr√°vaks as well as other
Hindus worship. In the centre of the shrine is a leaning pillar about
five feet high with four fronts, Hanum√°n on the east, a standing
Snake on the south, a <span class="corr" id="xd25e37137" title="Source: Sakti">&#346;akti</span> on the west, and Bhairav on the
north. To the south of the pillar, about a foot out of the ground rises
a five-faced <i>lin&#775;g</i> or pillar-home of the god one facing
each quarter of the heaven and one uncarved facing the sky. Close to a
well within the circuit of the lake near the south-east corner is a
stone inscribed with letters which are too worn to be read. At the east
end of the north bank under a <i>pilu</i> Salvadora persica tree is a
massive seated figure still worshipped and still dignified though the
features have been broken off, and the left lower arm and leg and both
feet have disappeared. This is believed to be the image of the Yaksha
king who made the tank. Details are given Below pages 456&ndash;458. To
the west of the seated statue are the marks of the foundations of a
temple, shrine hall and outer hall, which is believed to have
originally been the shrine of Yaksh. About a hundred yards west, under
a pillared canopy of white quartz, are two Musalm√°n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>

Ham√°l Kh√°n who were killed about 400 years ago at
Jh√°lor fighting for Shrim√°l. In obedience to their dying
request their Bh√°ts brought the champions&rsquo; bodies to
Yaksh&rsquo;s tank. The white quartz, the shape of the pillars, and an
inscription on one of them dated <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr>
1333 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1276), go to show that the
stones have been brought from the Sun temple to the south of the town.
To the north of the canopy is a large step-well the Dadeli Well
separated into an outer and an inner section by a row of Hindu pillars
supporting flat architraves. Some of the stones have figures of
goddesses and in a niche is an old goddess&rsquo; image. The upper part
of the well and the parapet are of recent brick work. On a low mound
about 150 yards to the north is the shrine of Nilkanth
M√°h√°dev, with, about a hundred paces to the south-east, a
fine old step-well. The lake was fed from the south-west corner where
is a silt trap built of stones in many cases taken from old temples and
carved with the <i>chaitya</i> or horse-shoe ornament. Some of the
stones have apparently been brought from the great white quartz Sun
temple. Several of them have a few letters of the fourteenth century
character apparently the names of masons or carvers. Some of the blocks
are of a rich red sandstone which is said to be found only in the Rupe
quarries eight miles south of Bhinm√°l.</p>
<p>On the right, about half a mile south of the south-west corner of
the Jaikop lake, is a ruined heap hid among trees called the Pipal
Du√°ra or Gateway perhaps the remains of the western Gateway
which may have formed part of the later line of fortifications which
can be traced running south along the inner bank of the Jaikop feeding
channel. About a mile south of the Pipal Du√°ra are the bare
banks of the large lake Bansarovar the Desert Sea. To the north-west
north and north-east its great earthen banks remain stripped of their
masonry gradually sloping to the west and south the direction of its
supply of water. The island in the centre is Lakh√°ra. This lake
was made by Gauri or P√°rvati when she came from Sunda hill to
slay the female demon Uttamiy√°r. When P√°rvati killed the
demon she piled over her body Shri&rsquo;s hill which she had brought
with her to form a burial mound. At the same time P√°rvati
scooped the tank, and crowned Shri&rsquo;s hill with a tower-like
temple. This hill, where lives the &#346;r&iacute; or Luck of
Shrim√°l, rises 500 feet out of the plain about a mile west of
the town. It is approached from the south by a flight of unhewn stones
roughly laid as steps. The hill-top is smoothed into a level pavement
of brick and cement. The pavement is supported on the east side by a
lofty bastion-like wall. It is surrounded by a parapet about two feet
high. On the platform two shrines face eastwards. To the left or south
is the main temple of Lakshm&iacute; and to the right or north the
smaller shrine of Su&#7751;&#7693;a M√°ta. The main shrine has a
porch with pillars and shield frieze of white quartz limestone
apparently spoils of the great Sun Temple. Three or four bells hang
from the roof of the porch and some loose white stones apparently also
from the Sun temple are scattered about. In the west wall of the main
shrine facing east is the image of the Guardian of Bhinm√°l
covered with red paint and gold leaf. The only trace of ornament on the
outside of Lakshm&iacute;&rsquo;s shrine is in the north-face portion
of a belt of the horse-shoe or <i>chaitya</i> pattern and a disc
perhaps the disc of the Sun. The smaller shrine of Su&#7751;&#7693;a
M√°ta to the right or north is square and flat-roofed. The
ceiling is partly made of carved stones apparently prepared for,
perhaps formerly the centre slabs of domes. The door posts and lintels
are of white quartz marble. On the right door post are two short
inscriptions of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1612 and 1664
(<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1669 and 1691). A second pillar
bears the date <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1543 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>

1600). The roof is supported by four square central pillars which with
eight wall pilasters form four shallow domes with lotus carved
roof-stones from some other or some older temple. In a recess in the
west wall, surmounted with a stone carved in the <i>chaitya</i> or
horse-shoe pattern, is the Trident or <i>Trisula</i> of
Su&#7751;&#7693;a M√°ta the only object of worship.</p>
<p>From the hill-top the mound of Bhinm√°l hardly seems to stand
out of the general level. The mound seems hidden in trees. Only in the
south gleam the white pillars of the Sun Temple and to the north rise
the high mound of the old offices, and still further north the spires
of the four temples of <span class="corr" id="xd25e37214" title="Source: Parasn√°th">P√°rasn√°th</span>. Beyond the
town to the south and west spread green gardens fenced with dry thorn
hedges. Outside of the garden enclosures to the south-east south and
south-west run the lofty bare banks of dry lakes confused in places
with the lines of old fortifications. To the north-west and north shine
the waters of the Jaikop and Gautam tanks. Westwards the plain, dark
with thorn brake and green with acacias, stretches to the horizon. On
other sides the sea-like level of the plain is broken by groups of
hills the Borta range along the north and north-east and to the east
the handsomer Ratan√°gar, Thur, and Ram Sen rising southwards to
the lofty clear-cut ranges of Do&#7693;ala and Su&#7751;&#7693;a.</p>
<p>Only two objects of interest in Bhinm√°l require special
description, the massive broken statue of the Jaksha or Yaksha on the
north bank of the Jaikop lake, and the temple to Jagsv√°mi the
Sun at the south-east entrance to the city.</p>

on the right knee and holding a round ball of stone about six inches in
diameter. The left foot was drawn back like the right foot and the left

of the left leg is uncertain. The head is massive. The hair falls about

<i>Jaikop.</i></span> two feet from the crown of the head in four long
lines of curls on to the shoulders, and, over the curls, or what seems
more likely the curled wig, is a diadem or <i>mukut</i> with a central
spike and two upright side ornaments connected by two round bands. The
face is broken flat. It seems to have been clean shaved or at least
beardless. A heavy ring hangs from each ear. A stiff collar-like band
encircles the neck and strings of beads or plates hang on the chest too
worn to be distinguished. On both arms are upper armlets, a centre
lion-face still showing clear on the left armlet. On the right hand is
a bracelet composed of two outer bands and a central row of beads. A
light belt encircles the waist. Lower down are the <i>kandora</i> or
hip girdle and the <i>kopul</i> or <i>dhotar</i> knot.<a class="noteref" id="n457.1src" href="#n457.1" name="n457.1src">14</a> In
spite of its featureless face and its broken hands and feet the figure
has considerable dignity. The head is well set and the curls and diadem
are an effective ornament. The chest and the full rounded belly are
carved with skill. The main fault in proportion, the overshortened
lower arm and leg and the narrowness of the throne, are due to the want
of depth in the stone. The chief details of interest are the
figure&rsquo;s head-dress and the ball of stone in its right hand. The
head-dress seems to be a wig with a row of crisp round curls across the
brow and four lines of long curls hanging down to the shoulders and
crisp curls on the top of the head. The <i>mukut</i> or diadem has
three upright faces, a front face over the nose and side faces over the
ears joined together by two rounded bands. At first sight the stone
ball in the right hand seems a cocoanut which the king might hold in
dedicating the lake. Examination shows on the left side of the ball an
outstanding semicircle very like a human ear. Also that above the ear
are three rolls as if turban folds. And that the right ear may be hid
either by the end of the turban drawn under the chin or by the fingers
of the half-closed hand. That the front of the ball has been wilfully
smashed further supports the view that it was its human features that
drew upon it the Muslim mace. The local Br√°hmans contend that
the ball is either a round sweetmeat or a handful of mud held in the
right hand of the king during the dedication service. But Tappa a
Br√°hm-Bh√°t, a man of curiously correct information, was
urgent that the stone ball is a human head. Tappa gives the following
tale to explain why the king should hold a human head in his hand. An
evil spirit called Satka had been wasting the Br√°hmans by
carrying off the head of each bridegroom so soon as a wedding ceremony
was completed. The king vowed that by the help of his goddess
Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a he would put a stop to this evil. The marriage of
a hundred Br√°hman couples was arranged for one night. The king
sat by. So long as the king remained awake the demon dared not appear.
When the hundredth marriage was being performed the king gave way to
sleep. Satka dashed in and carried off the last bridegroom&rsquo;s
head. The girl-bride awoke the king and said I will curse you. You
watched for the others, for me you did not watch. The king said to his
Luck Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a, What shall I do. Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a said
Ride after Satka. The king rode after Satka. He overtook her fourteen
miles out of Shrim√°l and killed her. But before her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span>

<i>Jaikop.</i></span> death Satka had eaten the bridegroom&rsquo;s
head. What is to be done the king asked Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a. Trust me
said his guardian. The king rode back to Shrim√°l. As he was
entering the city the goddess pointed out to him a gardener or
M√°li and said <span class="corr" id="xd25e37320" title="Source: Off">off</span> with his head. The king obeyed. The goddess
caught the falling head, stuck it to the bridegroom&rsquo;s neck, and
the bridegroom came to life. Thus, ends the tale, the local
Br√°hmans are known as Shrim√°lis that is men with
gardeners&rsquo; heads. This meaning-making pun and the likeness of the
stone-ball to a human head may be the origin of this story. On the
other hand the story may be older than the image and may be the reason
why the king is shown holding a human head in his hand. On the whole it
seems likely that the story was made to explain the image and that the
image is a Bhairav holding the head of a human sacrifice and acting as
gatekeeper or guardian of some Buddhist or Sun-worshipping
temple.<a class="noteref" id="n458.1src" href="#n458.1" name="n458.1src">15</a> The appearance of the figure, its massive
well-proportioned and dignified pose, and the long wiglike curls, like
the bag wig on the figure of Ch√°nd on the south-west or marriage
compartment of the great Elephanta Cave, make it probable that this
statue is the oldest relic of Shrim√°l, belonging like the
Elephanta wigged figures to the sixth or early seventh century the
probable date of the founding or refounding of the city by the
Gurjjar√°s.<a class="noteref" id="n458.2src" href="#n458.2" name="n458.2src">16</a> According to the local story the image stands about
twenty paces east of the temple where it was originally enshrined and
worshipped. The lie of the ground and traces of foundations seem to
show about fifty paces west of the present image the sites of an
entrance porch, a central hall or <i>mandap</i>, and a western shrine.
The surface of what seemed the site of the shrine was dug about two
feet deep on the chance that the base of the throne might still be in
site. Nothing was found but loose brickwork. Mutilated as he is the
Yaksha is still worshipped. His high day is the <i>A&rsquo;shad</i>

Sun Temple.</span> <span class="marginnote">Sun Temple.</span>The
second and main object of interest is the ruined Sun temple in the
south of the town on a brick mound about eighty yards east of the
remains of the Gujar√°t gateway. The brick mound which is crowned
by the white marble pillars and the massive laterite ruins of the
temple of Jagsv√°mi Lord of the World has been so dug into that
its true form and size cannot be determined. The size of many of the
bricks 1&prime; 16&Prime; &times; 1&prime; &times; 3&Prime; suggests
that the mound is older even than the massive laterite masonry of the
shrine. And that here as at Mult√°n about the sixth century
during the supremacy of the sun-worshipping White H&uacute;&#7751;as a
temple of the Sun was raised on the ruins of a Buddhist temple or relic
mound. Still except the doubtful evidence of the size of the bricks
nothing has been found to support the theory that the Sun temple stands
on an earlier Buddhist ruin. The apparent present dimensions of the
mound are 42&prime; broad 60&prime; long and 20&prime; high. Of the
temple the north side and north-west corner are fairly complete. The
east entrance to the hall, the south pillars of the hall, and with them
the hall dome and the outer wall of the temple round the south and west
of the shrine have disappeared. A confused heap of bricks on the top of
the shrine and of the entrance from the hall to the shrine is all that
is left of the spire and upper buildings. The materials used are of
three kinds. The pillars of the hall are of a white quartzlike marble;
the masonry of the shrine walls and of the passage round the north of
the shrine is of a reddish yellow laterite, and the interior of the
spire and apparently some other roof buildings are of brick. Beginning
from the original east entrance the ground has been cut away so close
to the temple and so many of the pillars have fallen that almost no
trace of the entrance is left. The first masonry, entering from the
east, are the two eastern pillars of the hall dome and to the north of
this central pair the pillar that supported the north-eastern corner of
the dome. Except the lowest rim, on the east side, all trace of the
dome and of the roof over the dome are gone. The centre of the hall is
open to the sky. The south side is even more ruined than the east side.
The whole outer wall has fallen and been removed. The south-east corner
the two south pillars of the dome and the south-west corner pillars are
gone. The north side is better preserved. The masonry that rounds off
the corners from which the dome sprung remains and along the rim of the
north face runs a belt of finely carved female figures. The north-east
corner pillar, the two north pillars of the dome, and the north-west
corner pillar all remain. Outside of the pillars runs a passage about
four feet broad and eleven feet high, and, beyond the passage, stands
the north wall of the temple with an outstanding deep-eaved window
balcony with white marble seats and backs and massive pillars whose six
feet shafts are in three sections square eightsided and round and on
whose double-disc capitals rest brackets which support a shallow
cross-cornered dome. At its west end the north passage is ornamented
with a rich <i>gokla</i> or recess 3&frac12; broad with side pillars
3&frac14; feet high. On the west side of the dome the central pair of
dome pillars and as has been noticed the north corner pillar remain.
About three feet west of the west pair of dome pillars a second pair
support the domed entrance to the shrine. The richly carved side
pillars, a goddess with fly-flap bearers, and the lintel of the shrine
door remain but the bare square chamber of the shrine is open to the
sky. To the south of the shrine the entire basis of the south side of
the spire, the outer circling or <i>pradakshana</i> passage and the
outer wall of the temple have disappeared. The north side is much less
ruinous. There remain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

formed the basis of the spire built in horizontal bands of deep-cut
cushions, and in the centre of the north wall a niche with outstanding
pillared frame, the circling passage with walls of plain trap and roof
of single slabs laid across and the outer wall of the temple with
bracket capitaled pillars and a central deep-eaved and pillared hanging
window of white marble. The circling passage and the outer wall of the
temple end at the north-west corner. Of the western outer wall all
trace is gone. The pillars of the temple are massive and handsome with
pleasantly broken outline, a pedestal, a square, an eightsided band, a
sixteensided band, a round belt, a narrow band of horned faces, the
capital a pair of discs, and above the discs outstanding brackets each
ending in a crouching four-armed male or female human figure upholding
the roof. The six central dome pillars resemble the rest except that
instead of the sixteensided band the inner face is carved into an urn
from whose mouth overhang rich leafy festoons and which stand on a roll
of cloth or a ring of cane such as women set between the head and the
waterpot.<a class="noteref" id="n460.1src" href="#n460.1" name="n460.1src">17</a> On the roof piles of bricks show that besides the

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>History.</i></span>According to a local
legend this temple of the Sun was built by Yayati the son of king
Nahush<a class="noteref" id="n460.2src" href="#n460.2" name="n460.2src">18</a> of the Chandravansi or Moon stock. Yayati came to
Shrim√°l accompanied by his two queens Sharmistha and Devyani,
and began to perform severe austerities at one of the places sacred to
Surya the Sun. Surya was so pleased by the fervour of Yayati&rsquo;s
devotion that he appeared before him and asked Yayati to name a boon.
Yayati said May I with god-like vision see thee in thy true form. The
Sun granted this wish and told Yayati to name a second boon. Yayati
said I am weary of ruling and of the pleasures of life. My one wish is
that for the good of Shrim√°lpur you may be present here in your
true form. The Sun agreed. An image was set up in the Sun&rsquo;s true
form (apparently meaning in a human form) and a Hariya Br√°hman
was set over it.<a class="noteref" id="n460.3src" href="#n460.3" name="n460.3src">19</a> The God said Call me Jagat-Sv√°mi the Lord of

from a hole close to the city gate and said to the king&rsquo;s belly
snake &lsquo;You should depart and cease to afflict the king.&rsquo;
&lsquo;There is a fine treasure in your hole&rsquo; said the belly
snake. &lsquo;How would you like to leave it? Why then ask me to leave
my home?&rsquo; The gate snake said &lsquo;If any servant of the king
is near let him hearken. If some leaves of the <i>kir</i> Capparis
aphylla tree are plucked and mixed with the flowers of a creeper that
grows under it and boiled and given to the king the snake inside him
will be killed.&rsquo; &lsquo;If any servant of the king is near&rsquo;
retorted the king&rsquo;s snake &lsquo;let him hearken. If boiling oil
is poured down the hole of the gate-snake the snake will perish and
great treasure will be found.&rsquo; A clever Kayasth of the
king&rsquo;s retinue was near and took notes. He found the <i>kir</i>
tree and the creeper growing under it: he prepared the medicine and
gave it to the king. The writhing of the snake caused the king so much
agony that he ordered the Kayasth to be killed. Presently the king
became sick and the dead snake was thrown up through the king&rsquo;s
mouth. The king mourned for the dead Kayasth. So clever a man, he said,
must have made other good notes. They examined the Kayasth&rsquo;s note
book, poured the boiling oil down the hole, killed the gate-snake, and
found the treasure. To appease the Kayasths and the two snakes
l√°khs were spent in feeding Br√°hmans. With the rest a
magnificent temple was built to the Sun and an image duly enshrined.
Nine upper stories were afterwards added by Vishvakarma.</p>

Mah√°tmya of the Skanda Pur√°na a work supposed to be about
400 years old. According to the Mah√°tmya the city has been known
by a different name in each of the chief cycles or Yugs. In the
Satyayug it was Shrim√°l, in the Tretayug Ratanm√°l, in the
Dw√°paryug Pushpamal, and in the K√°liyug Bhinm√°l.
In the Satyayug Shrim√°l or Shrinagar had 84 Chandis; 336
Kshetrap√°ls; 27 Var√°has; 101 Sury√°s; 51
M√°t√°s; 21 Brehispatis; 300 to 11,000 Lin&#775;gas; 88,000
Rushis; 999 Wells and Tanks; and 3&frac34; krors of <i>tirthas</i> or
holy places. At first the plain of Bhinm√°l was sea and
Bhraghurishi called on Surya and the sun dried the water and made it
land. Then Braghu started a hermitage and the saints Kashy√°p,
Atri, Baradwaj, Gautam, J√°mdagni, Vishvamitra, and Vashista came
from &Aacute;bu to interview Braghu. Gautam was pleased with the land
to the north of Braghu&rsquo;s hermitage and prayed Trimbakeshwar that
the place might combine the holiness of all holy places and that he and
his wife Ahilya might live there in happiness. The God granted the
sage&rsquo;s prayer. A lake was formed and in the centre an island was
raised on which Gautam built his hermitage the foundations of which may
still be seen. The channel which feeds Gautam&rsquo;s lake from the
north-east was cut by an ascetic Br√°hman named Yajanasila and in
the channel a stone is set with writing none of which but the date
<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1117 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1060) is legible. Some years after Gautam had
settled at Shrim√°l a daughter named Lakshm&iacute; was born in
the house of the sage Braghu. When the girl came of age Braghu
consulted Naradji about a husband. When Naradji saw Lakshm&iacute;, he

the holy Trimbak pond about half a mile east of Gautam&rsquo;s island.
The holy water cleared the veil of forgetfulness and Lakshm&iacute;
remembered her former life. The <i>devtas</i> or guardians came to
worship her. They asked her what she would wish. Lakshm&iacute;
replied; May the country be decked with the houses of Br√°hmans
as the sky is decked with their carriers the stars. Bhagw√°n that

golden bangles and a garland of gold lotus flowers and the promise that
his work would meet with the praise of men and that his descendants
would rule the art of building. This town said the Gods has been decked
as it were with the garlands or <i>m√°la</i> of &#346;r&iacute;

away their marriageable daughters. One girl as she was being haled away
called on her house goddess and Sarika was spell-bound to the spot.
King Shripunj came up and was about to slay Sarika with an arrow when
Sarika said Do not kill me. Make some provision for my food and I will
henceforth guard your Br√°hmans. The king asked her what she
required. Sarika said Let your Br√°hmans at their weddings give a
dinner in my honour and let them also marry their daughters in unwashed
clothes. If they follow these two rules I will protect them. The king
agreed and gave Sarika leave to go. Sarika could not move. While the
king wondered the home-goddess of the maiden appeared and told the king
she had stopped the fiend. Truly said the king you are the rightful
guardian. But Sarika is not ill disposed let her go. On this Sarika
fled to Sindh. And in her honour the people both of Shrim√°l and
of Jodhpur still marry their daughters in unwashed clothes.<a class="noteref" id="n463.1src" href="#n463.1" name="n463.1src">24</a> The
Br√°hman girls whom Sarika had carried off had been placed in
charge of the snake Kankal lord of the under world. The Br√°hmans
found this out and Kankal agreed to restore the girls if the
Br√°hmans would worship snakes or <i>n√°gs</i> at the
beginning of their <i>shr√°dh</i> or after-death ceremonies.

M√°rw√°r by Jag Som by which name apparently Kanaksen that

that from fear of him the Shrim√°li Br√°hmans and

<p>The memory of the Gurjjaras, who they say are descended from Garab
Rishi, lingers among the Bh√°ts or bards of Shrim√°l. They
say the Gurjjaras moved from Shrim√°l to Pushkar about ten miles
north-west of Ajm&iacute;r and there dug the great lake. They are aware
that Gurjjaras have a very sacred burning ground at Pushkar or Pokarn
and also that the <span class="corr" id="xd25e37715" title="Source: Savitri">S√°vitr&iacute;</span> or wife of Brahma at
Pokarn was a Gurjjara maiden.</p>
<p>But as the leading Gurjjar√°s have dropped their tribe name in
becoming Kshatriy√°s or <span class="corr" id="xd25e37720" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> the bards naturally do not know
of the Gurjjaras as a ruling race. The ordinary Gurjjara they say is
the same as the Rehb√°ri; the Bad or High Gujjars to whom
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a belonged are <span class="corr" id="xd25e37723"
title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>. The bards further say
that the Sompuras who live near Poshkar (Pokarn north of Ajm&iacute;r)
and are the best builders who alone know the names of all ornamental
patterns are of Gurjjara descent and of Shrim√°l origin. They do
not admit that the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s were Gurjjar√°s.
In their opinion Ch√°va&#7693;√°s are the same as
Bh√°rods and came north into M√°rw√°r from
D√°nta in Jh√°l√°v√°&#7693;a in north-east
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a. The Choh√°ns they say came
from S√°mbhar to Ajm&iacute;r, from Ajm&iacute;r to Delhi, from
Delhi to N√°gor north of Jodhpur, from N√°gor to Jodhpur,
from Jodhpur to Bhadgaon thirty miles south of Bhinm√°l, and from
Bhadgaon to Sirohi. According to a local Jaghird√°r of the Devra
caste the Choh√°ns&rsquo; original seat was at Jh√°lor
forty miles north of Shrim√°l. They say that in the eighteenth
century the Solan&#775;kis came north from P√°tan in north
Gujar√°t to Hiyu in P√°lanpur where they have still a
settlement, and that from Hiyu they went to Bhinm√°l.</p>
<p>In connection with the Sun temple and the traces of sun worship
among the Jains, whose <i>gurus</i> or religious guides have a sun face
which they say was given them by the R√°na of Chitor, the
existence in Bhinm√°l of so many (thirty-five) houses of Shevaks
is interesting. These Shevaks are the religious dependents of the
Osw√°l Shr√°vaks. They are strange highnosed hatchet-faced
men with long lank hair and long beards and whiskers. They were
originally Magha Br√°hmans and still are Vaishnavas worshipping
the sun. They know that their story is told in the N√°magranth of
the Surya Pur√°na. The Bhinm√°l Shevaks know of sixteen

names of ten only: Aboti, Bhinm√°la, Devira, Hirgota, Kuwara,
Lal√°r, Mahtariya, Mundiara, Saparw√°la, and Sh√°nda.
The story of these Magh√°s in the Surya and Bhavishya
<span class="corr" id="xd25e37747" title="Source: Pur√°nas">Pur√°&#7751;as</span>, how they were
brought by <span class="corr" id="xd25e37750" title="Source: Garuda">Garu&#7693;a</span> from the land of the &#346;akas
and were fire and sun worshippers, gives these Shevaks a special
interest. The Deval√°s are believed to have come from
Kashm&iacute;r with Jog Sv√°mi who is said to have been a Yaksh
of the R√°kshas division of Parih√°r <span class="corr" id="xd25e37754" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span>. The other
division of Parih√°rs were <i>gir√°sias</i> of &Aacute;bu
who in virtue of the fire baptism of the Agnikund became
Kshatriy√°s. The Deval√°s are supposed to get their name
because they built Jag Som&rsquo;s temple at Bhinm√°l. The Devra
<span class="corr" id="xd25e37760" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> whose head is the Sirohi chief
and who according to the bards are of Choh√°n descent, came at
the same time and marry with the Deval√°s. With this origin from
Kanaksen it is natural to associate the Devras and Deval√°s with
the Devaputras of the Samudragupta (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;370&ndash;395) inscription. Of H&uacute;&#7751;a

traced. The Jaghird√°r of Devala knows the name
H&uacute;&#7751;a. They are a R√°kshasa people he says. He
mentions Honots or Sonots who may be a trace of H&uacute;&#7751;as, and
H&uacute;&#7751;√°ls in K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a and
a Hu&#7751;i subdivision among the Kunbis of M√°rw√°r.
J√°vla he does not know as a caste name.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">History.</span>The historical interest of
Shrim√°l centres in the fact that it was long the capital of the
main branch of the great northern race of Gurjjaras. It is well known
that many mentions of the Gurjjaras and their country in inscriptions
and historical works refer to the Chaulukya or Solan&#775;ki kingdom of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e37776" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242) or to its successor
the V√°ghel√° principality (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1219&ndash;1304). But the name Gurjjara occurs
also in many documents older than the tenth century and has been most
variously and inconsistently explained. Some take the name to denote
the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of <span class="corr" id="xd25e37785"
title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;746&ndash;942), some the Gurjjaras
of Broach (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580&ndash;808) and some,
among them Dr. Bhagv√°nl√°l <span class="corr" id="xd25e37795" title="Source: Indr√°ji">Indraji</span>, even the
Valabhis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766), but not one
of these identifications can be made to apply to all cases. As regards
the Valabhis even if they were of Gurjjara origin they are not known to
have at any time called themselves Gurjjaras or to have been known by
that name to their neighbours. The identification with the Gurjjaras of
Broach is at first sight more plausible, as they admitted their
Gurjjara origin as late as the middle of the seventh century, but there
are strong reasons against the identification of the Broach branch as
the leading family of Gurjjaras. Pulake&#347;i II. in his Aihole
inscription of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634 (<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 556)<a class="noteref" id="n465.1src" href="#n465.1" name="n465.1src">28</a> claims to have subdued by his prowess
the L√°&#7789;as M√°lavas and Gurjjaras, which shows that
the land of the Gurjjaras was distinct from L√°&#7789;a, the
province in which Broach stood. Similarly Hiuen Tsiang (c. 640
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>) speaks of the kingdom of Broach by the
name of the city and not as Gurjjara or the Gurjjara country. In the
following century the historians of the Arab raids<a class="noteref"
id="n465.2src" href="#n465.2" name="n465.2src">29</a> notice Barus
(Broach) separately from Jurz or Gurjjara, and the Ch√°lukya
grant of 490 that is of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738&ndash;739
mentions the Gurjjaras after the Ch√°vo&#7789;akas
(Ch√°va&#7693;√°s) and the Mauryas (of Chitor) as the last
of the kingdoms attacked by the Arab army. Later instances occur of a
distinction between L√°&#7789;a and Gurjjara, but it seems
unnecessary to quote them as the Gurjjara kingdom of Broach probably
did not survive the <span class="corr" id="xd25e37820" title="Source: R√°shtrak&uacute;&#7789;a">R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a</span>

Ch√°va&#7693;√° kingdom, and further we find the
Ch√°lukya grant of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738&ndash;739 expressly distinguishing between
the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s and the Gurjjaras and calling the
former by their tribal name Ch√°vo&#7789;aka. It might be
supposed that as the power of the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s
increased, they became known as the rulers of the Gurjjara country; and
it must be admitted that some of the references to Gurjjaras in the

Still, if it can be shown that others of these references cannot
possibly apply to the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s, and if we assume,
as we must, that the name of Gurjjara was used with the slightest
consistency, it will follow that the ninth and tenth century references

name="n466.2src">31</a> which is dated <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;812&ndash;813, to the effect that Karka made his
arm &ldquo;the door-bar of the country of the lord of the Gurjjaras,
who had become evilly inflamed by conquering the lord of Gau&#7693;a
and the lord of Vanga&rdquo; makes it highly probable that
Vatsar√°ja was king of the Gurjjaras at the end of the eighth
century. As no such name occurs in the Ch√°va&#7693;√°
lists, it follows that the Gurjjaras referred to in the inscriptions of
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;800 were not
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s.</p>
<p>It is also possible to show that more than a century later the
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s were distinct from the Gurjjaras. The
K√°narese poet Pampa, writing in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;941,<a class="noteref" id="n466.3src" href="#n466.3" name="n466.3src">32</a> states that the father of his patron
Arikesari vanquished Mahip√°la king of the Gurjjaras, who may be
identified with the Mahip√°la who is named as overlord in the
grant of <span class="corr" id="xd25e37889" title="Source: Dhara&#7751;ivar√°ha">Dhara&#7751;&iacute;var√°ha</span>

no Mahip√°la occurs in the Ch√°va&#7693;√° lists, the
Gurjjara kingdom must be sought elsewhere than at <span class="corr"

Since the Gurjjaras of the eighth and ninth century inscriptions cannot
be identified either with the Valabhis, the Broach Gurjjaras, or the

Ch√°va&#7693;√°s, they must represent some other family of
rulers. A suitable dynasty seems to be supplied by Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s
kingdom of <span class="corr" id="xd25e37905" title="Source: Ki&uacute;-che-lo">Kiu-che-lo</span> or Gurjjara, the capital

History.</span> A short sketch of the history of the Gurjjaras, so far
as it can be pieced together from contemporary sources, may help to
show the probability of these identifications. The Gurjjaras apparently
entered India in the fifth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> The
earliest notice of them occurs in the &#346;r&iacute; Harshacharita, a
work of the early seventh century, in which during the early years of
the seventh century <span class="corr" id="xd25e37938" title="Source: Prabh&acirc;karavardhana">Prabh√°karavardhana</span> the
father of &#346;r&iacute; Harsha of Magadha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;606&ndash;641) is said to have conquered the king
of Gandh√°ra, the H&uacute;&#7751;as, the king of Sindh, the
Gurjjaras, the L√°&#7789;as, and the king of
M√°lava.<a class="noteref" id="n467.1src" href="#n467.1" name="n467.1src">36</a> The date of their settlement at Bhinm√°l is
unknown, but as their king was recognised as a Kshatriya in Hiuen
Tsiang&rsquo;s time (c. 640 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) it probably
was not later than <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;550. Towards the
end of the sixth century (c. 585) they seem to have conquered northern
Gujar√°t and Broach and to have forced the Valabhis (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;766) to acknowledge their supremacy.
(See <span class="corr" id="xd25e37957" title="Source: Above">above</span> page <a href="#pb465" class="pageref">465</a>.) They took very kindly to Indian culture, for in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;628 the astronomer Brahmagupta wrote
his Siddh√°nta at Bhinm√°l under king Vy√°ghramukha,
who, he states, belonged to the &#346;r&iacute; Ch√°pa
dynasty.<a class="noteref" id="n467.2src" href="#n467.2" name="n467.2src">37</a> This valuable statement not only gives the name of
the Gurjjara royal house but at the same time proves the Gurjjara
origin of the Ch√°po&#7789;ka&#7789;as or
Ch√°vo&#7789;akas, that is the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of
later times. This Vy√°ghramukha is probably the same as the
Gurjjara king whom in his inscription of <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 556 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;634)
Pulake&#347;i II. claims to have subdued.<a class="noteref" id="n467.3src" href="#n467.3" name="n467.3src">38</a> A few years later
(c. 640 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) Hiuen Tsiang describes the king
(probably Vy√°ghramukha&rsquo;s successor) as a devout Buddhist
and just twenty years of age. The country was populous and wealthy, but
Buddhists were few and unbelievers many. The Gurjjaras did not long
retain their southern conquests. In Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s time both
Kaira (Kie-cha) and Vadnagar (&Aacute;nandapura) belonged to
M√°lava, while the Broach chiefs probably submitted to the
Ch√°lukyas. No further reference to the Bhinm√°l kingdom
has been traced until after the Arab conquest of Sindh when
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;724&ndash;750) the Khalifa&rsquo;s
governor Junaid sent his plundering bands into all the neighbouring
countries and attacked among other places M√°rw√°d
(M√°rw√°r), Maliba (M√°lwa), Barus (Broach), Uzain
(Ujjain), Al Bailam√°n (Bhilm√°l&nbsp;?), and Jurz
(Gurjjara).<a class="noteref" id="n467.4src" href="#n467.4" name="n467.4src">39</a> As noticed above the contemporary Ch√°lukya
plate of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;738&ndash;9 also mentions
Gurjjara as one of the kingdoms attacked. After these events the Arabs
seem to have confined themselves to raiding the coast towns of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a without attacking inland states
such as Bhinm√°l. Immediately after the Arab raids ceased the
Gurjjaras had to meet a new enemy the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as who after supplanting the
Ch√°lukyas in the Dakhan turned their attention northwards.

Appendix III.<br>
<span class="sc">Bhinm√°l.</span><br>
History.</span> The next notice of the Gurjjaras occurs in the
R√°dhanpur and Van-Dindori grants of Govinda III.<a class="noteref" id="n468.1src" href="#n468.1" name="n468.1src">43</a> who
states that his father Dhruva (c. 780&ndash;800 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) caused &ldquo;Vatsar√°ja, intoxicated with the
goddess of the sovereignty of Gau&#7693;a that he had acquired with
ease, to enter upon the path of misfortune in the centre of Maru&rdquo;
and took from him the two white umbrellas of Gau&#7693;a. As already
stated, a comparison with the Baroda grant of Karka II.<a class="noteref" id="n468.2src" href="#n468.2" name="n468.2src">44</a> shows
that this Vatsar√°ja was a Gurjjara king and that he had made
extensive conquests in Upper India as far east as Bengal. Now it is
notable that the genealogies of two of the most important Agnikula
races, the Param√°ras and the Chauh√°ns, go back to this
very time (c. 800 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>)<a class="noteref" id="n468.3src" href="#n468.3" name="n468.3src">45</a>. Taking this fact in
connection with the prevalence of the surnames Pav√°r and
Chav√°n among Gujars in such remote provinces as the
Panj√°b and Kh√°ndesh, it seems obvious that these two
tribes and therefore also the two other Agnikula races, the
Parih√°rs and Solan&#775;kis are, if not of Gurjjara origin, at
all events members of the great horde of northern invaders whom the
Gurjjaras led. The agreement between this theory and the Agnikula
legends of &Aacute;bu need only be pointed out to be admitted. The
origin of the modern <span class="corr" id="xd25e38056" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> races has always been one of the
puzzles of Indian history. This suggestion seems to offer at least a
partial solution.</p>
<p>The R√°dhanpur grant (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;807&ndash;8) further states that when the
Gurjjara saw Govinda III. approaching, he fled in fear to some unknown
hiding-place. This probably means no more than that Vatsar√°ja
did not oppose Govinda in his march to the Vindhyas. The next reference
is in the Baroda grant of Karka II. of Gujar√°t who boasts that
his father Indra (c. 810 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) alone caused the
leader of the Gurjjara lords to flee. Karka adds that he himself, for
the purpose of protecting M√°lava, &ldquo;who had been struck
down,&rdquo; made his arm the door-bar of the country of
Gurjjare&#347;vara, who &ldquo;had become evilly inflamed&rdquo; by the
conquest of Gau&#7693;a and Vanga.<a class="noteref" id="n468.4src"
href="#n468.4" name="n468.4src">46</a> It is difficult to avoid
supposing that we have here a reference to the Param√°ra conquest
of M√°lwa and that Karka checked the southward march of the
victorious army. For some years no further mention has been traced of
the Gurjjaras. But in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;851 the Arab
merchant Sulaiman states<a class="noteref" id="n468.5src" href="#n468.5" name="n468.5src">47</a> that the king of Juzr was one of the
kings &ldquo;around&rdquo; the <span class="corr" id="xd25e38080"
title="Source: Balhar√°">Balh√°ra</span>, that is the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a, and that he was very hostile to
the Musalm√°ns, which is not surprising, considering how his
kingdom was exposed to the Arab raids from Sindh. Dhruva III. of
Broach, in his Bagumr√° grant of <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;867<a class="noteref" id="n468.6src" href="#n468.6" name="n468.6src">48</a> speaks of &ldquo;the host of the
powerful Gurjjaras&rdquo; as one of the dangerous enemies he had to
fear. About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;890 a Gurjjara chief
named Alakh√°na ceded <span class="corr" id="xd25e38092" title="Source: Takkadesa">Takkade&#347;a</span> in the Panj√°b to
&#346;ankaravarmman of Kashmir.<a class="noteref" id="n468.7src" href="#n468.7" name="n468.7src">49</a> But as Alakh√°na was a vassal
of Lalliya, the &#346;√°hi of Ohind near Sw√°t, this event
did not affect the Bh&iacute;nm√°l empire. To about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;900 belongs the notice of the
R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a K&#7771;ish&#7751;a II. in the
Deoli and Navs√°ri grants<a class="noteref" id="n468.8src" href="#n468.8" name="n468.8src">50</a> where he is stated to have frightened
the Gurjjaras, destroyed the pride of L√°&#7789;a, and deprived
the coast people of sleep. His fights with the Gurjjaras are compared
to the storms of the rainy season, implying that while the relations of
the two empires continued hostile, neither was able to gain any
decisive advantage over the other. To this same period belongs Ibn
Khurd√°dba&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;912)

in the south as causing the hope of K√°lanjara and
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a to drop away from the heart of the Gurjjara. At
this time Kalinjar belonged to the Kalachuris of Central India and
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a or Chito&#7693; to the Gehlots of
Mew√°&#7693; and the phrase used by K&#7771;ish&#7751;a implies
that the Gurjjara chief had his eye on these two famous fortresses and
had perhaps already besieged them unsuccessfully. In either case this
notice is evidence of the great and far-reaching power of the
Gurjjaras. Masudi (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;915) notices that
the king of Juzr was frequently at war with the Balhara
(R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;a) and that he had a large army
and many horses and camels.</p>

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1057 and 1067 Bhinm√°l was
ruled by the Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja
K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar√°ja of the Param√°ra race. This is a
valuable confirmation of R√°jput tradition, according to
which<a class="noteref" id="n470.1src" href="#n470.1" name="n470.1src">60</a> the Param√°ra R√°ja of &Aacute;bu was
followed by the prince of &#346;r&iacute;m√°la, when he aided
M&uacute;lar√°ja against Graharipu (c. 990 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>) and the Param√°ras remained paramount in this
region until the beginning of the thirteenth century.<a class="noteref"
id="n470.2src" href="#n470.2" name="n470.2src">61</a> The title of
Mah√°r√°j√°dhir√°ja meant much less at this
period than it meant before the Valabhi kings had cheapened it. Still
it shows that K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar√°ja&rsquo;s rank was
considerably higher than that of a mere feudatory chieftain.
Inscription No. 3 gives the names of
K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar√°ja&rsquo;s father Dham&#775;dhuka and of
his grandfather Devar√°ja. The first of these two names occurs in
the main line of &Aacute;bu as the successor of Dh&uacute;mar√°ja
the first Param√°ra sovereign.<a class="noteref" id="n470.3src"
href="#n470.3" name="n470.3src">62</a> According to <span class="corr"
id="xd25e38261" title="Source: Rajput">R√°jput</span> tradition
the Param√°ras were at one time supreme in
Mar√°sthal&iacute; and held all the nine castles of the Waste.
But in the historical period their chief possessions in
M√°rw√°d lay about &Aacute;bu and Chandr√°vati,
though we have a glimpse of another branch maintaining itself at
Ker√°lu near B√°dmer.<a class="noteref" id="n470.4src"
href="#n470.4" name="n470.4src">63</a> The Param√°ra chiefs of
&Aacute;bu are constantly referred to in the Solan&#775;ki annals, and
during the golden age of the Solan&#775;ki monarchy (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1094&ndash;1174) they were the vassals of that
power, and their Bhinm√°l branch, if it was ever a distinct
chiefship, probably followed the fortunes of the main line, though the
Bhinm√°l inscriptions give us no facts for this long period. The
next item of information is given by Inscription 5, which is dated in
the Sam&#775;vat year 1239 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1183) in
the reign of the Mah√°raul &#346;r&iacute;
Jayatas&iacute;ha-deva. This name is of special interest, as it can
hardly be doubted that we have here to do with that
&ldquo;Jaits&iacute; Parm√°r&rdquo; of &Aacute;bu whose
daughter&rsquo;s beauty caused the fatal feud between
&ldquo;Bh&iacute;ma Solan&#775;ki&rdquo; of <span class="corr" id="xd25e38273" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>

<p>Towards the end of the thirteenth century the old world was falling
to pieces, and the Param√°ras lost one after another nearly all
their ancient possessions to the Choh√°ns of N√°&#7693;ol.
Bhinm√°l must have fallen about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1200 or a few years before, for Inscription No. 6

&#346;r&iacute; Udayasim&#775;had&ecirc;va, who, as we learn from
Inscription 12, was the son of the Mah√°raul &#346;r&iacute;
Samarasim&#775;hadeva, of the Choh√°n race. The sudden rise of
the son to greatness is implied in the difference of title and it may
be inferred that Udayasim&#775;ha himself was the conqueror of
Bhinm√°l, though the capture of &Aacute;bu is ascribed by Forbes
to a chief named L&uacute;niga.<a class="noteref" id="n470.6src" href="#n470.6" name="n470.6src">65</a></p>
<p>Inscriptions Nos. 6 to 8 being dated in the reign of
Udayasim&#775;ha, show that he lived to at least the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1249 and therefore reigned at least forty-three
years. He is also referred to in the Inscription No. 10, dated
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1274, but in a way that does not
necessarily imply that he was still alive, as the record only speaks of
an endowment for his spiritual benefit, made by a person who was
perhaps an old retainer. His name also occurs in the genealogy in No.
12. His reign was apparently a prosperous one but no historical facts
beyond those already noted are known about him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span></p>

History.</span> Inscription No. 12 shows that Udayasim&#775;ha had a
son named V√°ha&#7693;hasim&#775;ha, who, as he is given no royal
title, probably died before his father. Udayasim&#775;ha&rsquo;s
successor, or at all events the next king in whose reign grants are
dated, was C√°ciga, who is given the title of Mah√°raul in
Inscriptions 11 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1277) and 12
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1278).<a class="noteref" id="n471.1src" href="#n471.1" name="n471.1src">66</a> His relationship to
Udayasim&#775;ha does not clearly appear, but he was probably either an
elder brother or an uncle of the C√°mu&#7751;&#7693;a for whose
benefit the gift recorded in Inscription 12 was made and who seems to
be a grandson of Udayasim&#775;ha. C√°ciga appears to be the
Mah√°ma&#7751;&#7693;ale&#347;vara C√°ciga of Inscription
15 in the Bh√°unagar State Collection (<abbr>Bh√°u.
Pr√°<span class="corr" id="xd25e38324" title="Not in source">.</span></abbr> I. list page 5) which is stated to bear
the date Sam&#775;vat 1332 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1276) and
to be engraved on a pillar in the temple of P√°rsvan√°tha
at Ratanpur near <span class="corr" id="xd25e38331" title="Source: J&oacute;dhpur">Jodhp&uacute;r</span>. It is clear that he was
tributary to some greater power though it is not easy to say who his
suzerain was. At this period M√°rw√°r was in a state of
chaos under the increasing pressure of the R√°tho&#7693;s. Only
five years after C√°ciga&rsquo;s last date (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1278) we meet with the name of a new ruler, the
Mah√°raul <span class="corr" id="xd25e38337" title="Source: Sr&iacute;">&#346;r&iacute;</span> S√°mvatasim&#775;ha.
He is mentioned in Inscriptions 13 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1283) 14 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1286)
and 15 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1289) and also in 44 of the
Bh√°unagar Collection (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1296
<abbr>Bh√°u. Pr√°.</abbr> I. list page 13) from a Jain
temple at Jun√°. He is not stated to have belonged to the same
family as the previous rulers, but he bears the family title of
Mah√°raul, and it may be inferred with probability that he was a
son of C√°ciga. He reigned for at least thirteen years
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1283&ndash;1296). It must have been
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1300 or a little later, that
the <span class="corr" id="xd25e38362" title="Source: Ch&oacute;h√°ns">Choh√°ns</span> were deprived of
Bhinm√°l by the R√°tho&#7693;s and the line of

<p><span class="marginnote">Inscriptions.</span>The Jagsv√°mi
temple has the honour of supplying fifteen of eighteen unmodern
inscriptions found at Bhinm√°l. Of the fifteen inscriptions
belonging to Jagsv√°mi&rsquo;s temple nine are in place and six
have been removed to other buildings. Of the six which have been moved
five are in B√°r√°ji&rsquo;s rest-house in the east and one
is in the enclosure of Mah√°laksh√°m&iacute;&rsquo;s temple
in the south of the town. Of the three remaining inscriptions of one
(No. 3) the date <abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 1106

to Bim√°l 15 <i>kos</i>: Bim√°l to Modra 15 <i>kos</i>. Of
Jh√°lor Ufflet has left the following description. Jh√°lor
is a castle on the top of a steep mountain three <i>kos</i> in ascent
by a fair stone causeway broad enough for two men. At the end of the
first <i>kos</i> is a gate and a place of guard where the causeway is
enclosed on both sides with walls. At the end of the second <i>kos</i>
is a double gate strongly fortified; and at the third <i>kos</i> is the
castle which is entered by three successive gates. The first is very
strongly plated with iron, the second not so strong with places above
for throwing down melted lead or boiling oil, and the third is thickly
beset with iron spikes. Between each of these gates are spacious places
of arms and at the inner gate is a strong portcullis. A bowshot within
the castle is a splendid pagoda, built by the founders of the castle
and ancestors of Ghazni (Gidney) Kh√°n who were Gentiles. He
turned Muhammadan and deprived his elder brother of this castle by the
following stratagem. Having invited him and his women to a banquet
which his brother requited by a similar entertainment he substituted
chosen soldiers well armed instead of women, sending them two and two
in a <i>dhuli</i> or litter who getting in by this device gained
possession of the gates and held the place for the Great Mughal to whom
it now (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1611) appertains being one of
the strongest situated forts in the world. About half a <i>kos</i>
within the gate is a goodly square tank cut out of the solid rock said
to be fifty fathoms deep and full of excellent water. Quoted by Finch

Bhinm√°l as a centre of population is shown not only by the
Shrim√°li Br√°hmans and V√°nis who are spread all
over Gujar√°t, but by the Porw√°rs a class of V√°nis
now unrepresented in their native town who are said to take their name
from a suburb of Bhinm√°l. Osw√°ls, almost all of whom are
Shr√°vaks or followers of the Jain religion, have practically
spread from Bhinm√°l. The origin of the name Osv√°l is
(Trans. Roy. As. Soc. III. 337) from Osi the Mother or Luck of
Osianagar an ancient town and still a place of pilgrimage about
eighteen miles north of Jodhpur. The Osw√°ls were originally
<span class="corr" id="xd25e36888" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> of several classes including
Paw√°rs but mainly Solan&#775;kis and so apparently (Tod&rsquo;s
Western India, 209) of Gurjjara origin. Equally of Gurjjara origin are
the Shrim√°li V√°nis who hold a specially high place among
Western Indian Jains. The care taken by the Jains to secure foreign
conquerors within their fold is notable. The Tirthankar is a
R√°ja who by piety and other virtues attained <i>moksha</i> or
absorption. The fifty-four worshipfuls <i>uttamapurushas</i>, the
twenty-four <i>tirthankars</i>, the twelve <i>chakravartis</i>, the
nine <i>b√°ladevas</i>, and the nine <i>v√°sudevas</i> are
R√°j√°s, most of them great conquerors (Trans. Royal
Asiatic Society. III. 338&ndash;341). The local story is that the
Solan&#775;kis were called to help the people of Shrim√°l to
resist the Songara <span class="corr" id="xd25e36910" title="Source: Rajputs">R√°jputs</span> of Jh√°lor who took
Bhinm√°l about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1290. Before
that the Shrim√°lis and Solan&#775;kis were enemies. This
tradition of hostility is interesting as it may go back to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;740 when M&uacute;lar√°ja Solan&#775;ki
transferred the seat of power from Bhinm√°l to <span class="corr"
id="xd25e36919" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>

light on the reason why this figure is called a Yaksha. The holding a
head in his hand suggests that he may have been a guardian Bhairav in
some Buddhist temple and so remembered as a guardian or Yaksha. Or he
may have been supposed to be a statue of the builder of the temple and
so have been called a Yaksha since that word was used for a race of
skilful architects and craftsmen. Troyer&rsquo;s
Rajataran&#775;g&iacute;n&iacute;, I. 369. In the Vrijji temples in
Tirhut which Buddhist accounts make older than Buddhism the objects of
worship were ancestral spirits who were called Yakshas. If the Buddhist
legends of &#346;aka settlements in Tirhut during Gautama&rsquo;s
lifetime (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;540) have any historical
value these Vrijjis were &#346;akas. As (<abbr title="Journal Asiatique">J. As.</abbr> <abbr title="Series">Ser.</abbr> VI.

Eastern Siberia the Turki tribe called Yakuts by the Russians and
Sokhas by themselves, <abbr title="Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica">Ency.
Brit.</abbr> XXIV. 725. This would explain why the mythic Yaksha was a
guardian, a builder, and a white horseman. It would explain why the
name Yaksha was given to the Baktrian Greeks who built stupas and
conquered India for A&#347;oka (<abbr title="Journal Asiatique">J.
As.</abbr> <abbr title="Series">Ser.</abbr> VII. Vol. VI. page 170;
Heeley in Indian Antiquary, IV. 101). It further explains how the name
came to be applied to the Yuechi or Kush√°ns who like the Yavanas
were guardians white horsemen and builders. In Sindh and Kachh the word
Yaksha seems to belong to the white Syrian horsemen who formed the
strength of Muhammad K√°sim&rsquo;s army, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;712. (Tod&rsquo;s Western India, 197;

Kank√°vati near the site of the present village of Chhakla about

That the name Bhilm√°l should have come into use while the
Gurjjaras were still in the height of their power is strange. The
explanation may perhaps be that Bhilm√°l may mean the
Gurjjara&rsquo;s town the name Bhil or bowman being given to the
Gurjjaras on account of their skill as archers. So Ch√°pa the
original name of the Ch√°va&#7693;√°s is Sanskritised into
Chapo&#7789;ka&#7789;as the strong bowmen. So also, perhaps, the
Ch√°pa or Chaura who gave its name to Ch√°panir or
Ch√°mpaner was according to the local story a Bhil. Several
tribes of Mew√°r Bhils are well enough made to suggest that in
their case Bhil may mean Gurjjara. This is specially the case with the
Lauriyah Bhils of Nerwer, the finest of the race, whose name further
suggests an origin in the Gurjjara division of Lor. Compare

(Ancient Geography, 313) the coins called T&acirc;tariya <i>dirhams</i>
stretch from the fifth and sixth to the eleventh century. They are
frequently found in K√°bul probably of the ninth century. In the
tenth century Ibn Haukal (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;977) found
them current in <span class="corr" id="xd25e38147" title="Source: Gandhara">Gandh√°ra</span> and the Panj√°b where
the Boar coin has since ousted them. They are rare in Central India
east of the Ar√°vali range. They are not uncommon in <span class="corr" id="xd25e38150" title="Source: Rajput√°na">R√°jput√°na</span> or
Gujar√°t and were once so plentiful in Sindh, that in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;725 the Sindh treasury had eighteen
million Tatariya dirhams. (See Dowson in Elliot&rsquo;s History, I. 3.)
They are the rude silver pieces generally known as Indo-Sassanian
because they combine Indian letters with Sassanian types. A worn fire
temple is the supposed Ass-head which has given rise to the name Gadiya

the early history of Gujar√°t from provincial narrowness and
raises its ruling tribes to a place among the greater conquerors and
colonisers. This incident is the tradition that during the sixth and
seventh centuries fleets from the coasts of Sindh and Gujar√°t
formed settlements in Java and in Cambodia. The Java legend is that
about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;603 Hindus led by
Bhruvij√°ya Savelach√°la the son of Kasamachitra or
B√°lya Ach√° king of Kujr√°t or Gujar√°t
settled on the west coast of the island.<a class="noteref" id="n489.1src" href="#n489.1" name="n489.1src">1</a> The details of the
settlement recorded by Sir Stamford Raffles<a class="noteref" id="n489.2src" href="#n489.2" name="n489.2src">2</a> are that
Kasamachitra, ruler of Gujar√°t, the tenth in descent from Arjun,
was warned of the coming destruction of his kingdom. He accordingly
started his son Bhruvij√°ya Savelach√°la with 5000
followers, among whom were cultivators artisans warriors physicians and
writers, in six large and a hundred small vessels for Java. After a
voyage of four months the fleet touched at an island they took to be
Java. Finding their mistake the pilots put to sea and finally reached
Matarem in the island of Java. The prince built the town of Mendang
Kumulan. He sent to his father for more men. A reinforcement of 2000
arrived among them carvers in stone and in brass. An extensive commerce
sprang up with Gujar√°t and other countries. The bay of Matarem
was filled with stranger vessels and temples were built both at the
capital, afterwards known as Brambanum, and, during the reign of
Bhruvij√°ya&rsquo;s grandson Ardivij√°ya that is about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;660, at Boro Buddor in Kedu.<a class="noteref" id="n489.3src" href="#n489.3" name="n489.3src">3</a> The
remark that an ancestor of the immigrant prince had changed the name of
his kingdom to Gujar√°t is held by Lassen to prove that the
tradition is modern. Instead of telling against the truth of the
tradition this note is a strong argument in its favour. One of the
earliest mentions of the name Gujar√°t for south
M√°rw√°r is Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630) Kiu-che-lo or Gurjjara. As when Hiuen Tsiang
wrote the Gurjjara chief of Bhinm√°l, fifty miles west of
&Aacute;bu, already ranked as a Kshatriya his family had probably been
for some time established perhaps as far back as <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;490 a date by which the Mihira or Gurjjara
conquest of Valabhi and north Gujar√°t was completed.<a class="noteref" id="n489.4src" href="#n489.4" name="n489.4src">4</a> The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix IV.<br>
<span class="sc">Java.</span></span> details of the help received from
Gujar√°t after the prince&rsquo;s arrival show that the parent
state had weathered the storm which threatened to destroy it. This
agrees with the position of the Bhinm√°l Gurjjaras at the opening
of the seventh century, when, in spite of their defeat by
Prabh√°karavardhana (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600&ndash;606) the father of &#346;r&iacute;
Harsha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;606&ndash;641) of Magadha,
they maintained their power at Broach and at Valabhi as well as at
Bhinm√°l.<a class="noteref" id="n490.1src" href="#n490.1" name="n490.1src">5</a> The close relations between the Gurjjaras and the
great seafaring Mihiras or Meds make it likely that the captains and
pilots who guided the fleets to Java belonged to the Med tribe. Perhaps
it was in their honour that the new Java capital received the name
Mendan, as, at a later period it was called Brambanum or the town of
Br√°hmans. The fact that the Gurjjaras of Broach were
sun-worshippers not Buddhists causes no difficulty since the
Bhilm√°l Gurjjaras whom Hiuen Tsiang visited in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630 were Buddhists and since at Valabhi Buddhism
Shaivism and sun-worship seem to have secured the equal patronage of
the state.</p>
<p>Besides of Gujar√°t and its king the traditions of both Java
and Cambodia contain references to Hastinagara or Hastinapura, to
Taxila, and to Rumadesa.<a class="noteref" id="n490.2src" href="#n490.2" name="n490.2src">6</a> With regard to these names and also
with regard to Gandh√°ra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491"
href="#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix IV.<br>
<span class="sc">Java.</span></span> and to Cambodia, all of which
places are in the north-west of India, the question arises whether the
occurrence of these names implies an historical connection with
K√°bul Pesh√°war and the west Panj√°b or whether they
are mere local applications and assumptions by foreign settlers and
converts of names known in the Br√°hman and Buddhist writings of
India.<a class="noteref" id="n491.1src" href="#n491.1" name="n491.1src">7</a> That elaborate applications of names mentioned in the
Mah√°bh√°rata to places in Java have been made in the Java
version of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e40530" title="Source: Mah√°bhar√°ta">Mah√°bh√°rata</span> is
shown by Raffles.<a class="noteref" id="n491.2src" href="#n491.2" name="n491.2src">8</a> Still it is to be noticed that the places mentioned
above, Kamboja or K√°bul, <span class="corr" id="xd25e40537"
title="Source: Gandhara">Gandh√°ra</span> or Pesh√°war,
Taxila or the west Panj√°b, and Rumadesa apparently the south
Panj√°b are not, like Ayodhya the capital of Siam or like
<i>Intha-patha-puri</i> that is Indraprastha or Dehli the later capital
of Cambodia,<a class="noteref" id="n491.3src" href="#n491.3" name="n491.3src">9</a> the names of places which either by their special
fame or by their geographical position would naturally be chosen as
their original home by settlers or converts in Java and Cambodia. Fair
ground can therefore be claimed for the presumption that the leading
position given to Kamboja, Gandh√°ra, Taxila, and Rumadesa in
Javan and Cambodian legends and place-names is a trace of an actual and
direct historical connection between the north-west of India and the
Malay Archipelago. This presumption gains probability by the argument
from the architectural remains of the three countries which in certain
peculiar features show so marked a resemblance both in design and in
detail as in the judgment of Mr. Fergusson to establish a strong and
direct connection.<a class="noteref" id="n491.4src" href="#n491.4"
name="n491.4src">10</a> A third argument in favour of a Gujar√°t
strain in Java are the traditions of settlements and expeditions by the
rulers of M√°lwa which are still current in south

<p class="first">Once more the connection with Gujar√°t is
supported by the detail in the Java account which makes Laut Mira the
starting point for the colonising fleet. This Sir S. Raffles supposed
to be the Red Sea but the Mihiras&rsquo; or Meds&rsquo; sea may be
suggested as it seems to correspond to the somewhat doubtful Arab name
Baharimad (sea of the Meds&nbsp;?) for a town in western India sacked
by Junaid. Against this evidence two considerations have been
urged<a class="noteref" id="n492.2src" href="#n492.2" name="n492.2src">13</a>: (<i>a</i>) The great length of the voyage from
Gujar√°t to Java compared with the passage to Java from the east
coast of India; (<i>b</i>) That no people in India have known enough of
navigation to send a fleet fit to make a conquest. As regards the
length of the voyage it is to be remembered that though Sumatra is more
favourably placed for being colonised from Bengal Orissa and the mouths
of the God√°vari and <span class="corr" id="xd25e40641" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>, in the case either of
Java or of Cambodia the distance from the Sindh and
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a ports is not much greater and the
navigation is in some respects both safer and simpler than from the
coasts of Orissa and Bengal. In reply to the second objection that no
class of Hindus have shown sufficient skill and enterprise at sea to
justify the belief that they could transport armies of settlers from
Gujar√°t to Java, the answer is that the assumption is erroneous.
Though the bulk of Hindus have at all times been averse from a
seafaring life yet there are notable exceptions. During the last two
thousand years the record of the Gujar√°t coast shows a genius
for seafaring fit to ensure the successful planting of north-west India
in the Malay Archipelago.<a class="noteref" id="n492.3src" href="#n492.3" name="n492.3src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493"

<span class="sc">Java.</span></span> Reasons have been given in support
of the settlement in Java of large bodies of men from the north-west
coasts of India and evidence has been offered to show that the
objections taken to such a migration have little practical force. It
remains to consider the time and the conditions of the Gujar√°t
conquest and settlement of Java and Cambodia. The Javan date
<abbr title="Sam&#803;vat">S.</abbr> 525 that is <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;603 may be accepted as marking some central event
in a process which continued for at least half a century before and
after the beginning of the seventh century. Reasons have been given for
holding that neither the commercial nor the political ascendancy of
Rome makes it probable that to Rome the R&uacute;m of the legends
refers. The notable Roman element in the architecture of Java and
Cambodia may suggest that the memory of great Roman builders kept for
Rome a place in the local legends. But the Roman element seems not to
have come direct into the buildings of Java or Cambodia; as at
Amr√°vati at the <span class="corr" id="xd25e41044" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> mouth, the classic
characteristics came by way of the Panj√°b (T√°hia) only,
in the case of Java, not by the personal taste and study of a prince,

connection with Mihirakula makes it probable that the chief in charge
of the north of the Aror dominions shared in the defeat and disgrace of
K√°rur. Seeing that the power of the S√°har√°is of
Aror spread as far south as the K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a
ports of Somn√°th and Diu, and probably also of Diul at the Indus
mouth, if the defeated chief of the south Panj√°b was unable or
unwilling to remain as a vassal to his conqueror, no serious difficulty
would stand in the way of his passage to the seaboard of Aror or of his
finding in Diu and other Sindh and Gujar√°t ports sufficient
transport to convey him and his followers by sea to Java.<a class="noteref" id="n497.1src" href="#n497.1" name="n497.1src">31</a> This

Their defeats by Sassanians and Turks between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;550 and 600 would close to the White
H&uacute;&#7751;as the way of retreat northwards by either the Indus or
the K√°bul valleys. If hard pressed the alternative was a retreat
to Kashmir or an advance south or east to the sea. When, in the early
years of the seventh century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600&ndash;606), Prabh√°karavardhana the
father of &#346;r&iacute; Harsha of Magadha (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;610&ndash;642) defeated the king of
Gandh√°ra, the H&uacute;&#7751;as, the king of Sindh, the

when, about twenty years later, further defeats were inflicted by
&#346;r&iacute; Harsha himself numbers of refugees would gather to the
Gujar√°t ports eager to escape further attack and to share the
prosperity of Java. It is worthy of note that the details of
Prabh√°karavardhana&rsquo;s conquests explain how Gandh√°ra
and L√°&#7789;a are both mentioned in the Java legends; how
northerners from the Panj√°b were able to pass to the coast; how
the M√°rw√°r stories give the king of M√°lwa a share
in the migrations; how the fleets may have started from any Sindh or

Cambodia, the alternate supremacy of Cambodia in Java and of Java in
Cambodia, the likelihood of settlers passing from Java to Cambodia
explain, to a considerable extent, why the traditions and the buildings
of Java and Cambodia should point to a common origin in north-west
India. The question remains: Do the people and buildings of Cambodia
contain a distinct north Hindu element which worked its way south and
east not by sea but by land across the <span class="corr" id="xd25e41228" title="Source: Himalayas">Him√°layas</span> and
Tibet and down the valley of the Yang-tse-kiang to Yunnan and Angkor.
Whether the name Cambodia<a class="noteref" id="n498.4src" href="#n498.4" name="n498.4src">39</a> proves an actual race or historical

Sir H. Yule held that the connection was purely literary and that as in
the case of Inthapatha-puri or Indraprastha (Dehli) the later capital
of Cambodia and of Ayodhya or Oudh the capital of Assam no connection
existed beyond the application to a new settlement of ancient
worshipful Indian place-names. The objection to applying this rule to
Cambodia is that except to immigrants from the K√°bul valley the
name is of too distant and also of too scanty a reputation to be chosen
in preference to places in the nearer and holier lands of Tirhut and
Magadha. For this reason, and because the view is supported by the
notable connection between the two styles of architecture, it seems
advisable to accept Mr. Fergusson&rsquo;s decision that the name
Cambodia was given to a portion of Cochin-China by immigrants from
Kamboja that is from the K√°bul valley. Traces remain of more
than one migration from India to Indo-China. The earliest is the mythic
account of the conversion of Indo-China to Buddhism before the time of
A&#347;oka (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;240). A migration in the
first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> of Yavanas or &#346;akas,
from Tamluk or Ratn√°vate on the Hugli, is in agreement with the
large number of Indian place-names recorded by Ptolemy (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;160).<a class="noteref" id="n499.1src" href="#n499.1" name="n499.1src">40</a> Of this migration Hiuen

how far there is trace of such a distinct migration as would explain
the close resemblance noted by Fergusson between the architecture of
Kashmir and Cambodia as well as the northern element which Fergusson
recognises in the religion and art of Cambodia.<a class="noteref" id="n500.5src" href="#n500.5" name="n500.5src">54</a> The people by whom
this Panj√°b and Kashmir influence may have been introduced from
the north are the people who still call themselves Khmers to whose
skill as builders the magnificence of Cambodian temples lakes and
bridges is apparently due.<a class="noteref" id="n500.6src" href="#n500.6" name="n500.6src">55</a> Of these people, who, by the
beginning of the eleventh century had already given their name to the
whole of Cambodia, Alberuni (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1031)

They follow the religion of the Hindus and have the practice of
piercing their ears.<a class="noteref" id="n500.7src" href="#n500.7"
name="n500.7src">56</a> It will be noticed that so far as information
is available the apparent holiness of the neighbourhood of Angkor had
lasted for at least 250 years before <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1078 when it was chosen as a capital. This point
is in agreement with Mr. Fergusson&rsquo;s view that the details of
Nakhonwat and other temples of that series show that the builders came
neither by sea nor down the Ganges valley but by way of Kashmir and the
back of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e41432" title="Source: Himalayas">Him√°layas</span>.<a class="noteref" id="n500.8src" href="#n500.8" name="n500.8src">57</a> Though the evidence

may perhaps be accepted that the Ephthalites or White

according to Chinese records this reverse was wiped out in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;713 by the defeat of the joint Arab and Tibet
armies.<a class="noteref" id="n501.5src" href="#n501.5" name="n501.5src">63</a> In the following years, aided by disorders in China,
Tibet conquered east to Hosi on the upper Hoangho and in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;729 ceased to acknowledge the overlordship of
China. Though about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;750 he was for a
time crippled by China&rsquo;s allies the Shado Turks the chief of
Tibet spread his power so far down the Yangtsekiang valley that in
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;787 the emperor of China, the king of
Yunnan to the east of Burma, certain Indian chiefs, and the Arabs
joined in a treaty against Tibet. As under the great Thisrong
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;803&ndash;845) and his successor
Thi-tsong-ti (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;878&ndash;901) the
power of Tibet increased it seems probable that during the ninth
century they overran and settled in Yunnan.<a class="noteref" id="n501.6src" href="#n501.6" name="n501.6src">64</a> That among the
Tibetans who passed south-east into Yunnan were Kedarites and White
H&uacute;&#7751;as is supported by the fact that about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1290, according both to Marco Polo and to
Rashid-ud-din, the common name of Yunnan was K√°r√°jang
whose capital was Yachi and whose people spoke a special
language.<a class="noteref" id="n501.7src" href="#n501.7" name="n501.7src">65</a> The name K√°r√°jang was Mongol meaning
Black People and was used to distinguish the mass of the inhabitants
from certain fair tribes who were known as Chaganjang or Whites. That
the ruler of K√°r√°jang was of Hindu origin is shown by his
title Mahara or Mah√°r√°ja. That the Hindu element came
from the K√°bul valley is shown by its Hindu name of <span class="corr" id="xd25e41540" title="Source: Kandhar">Kandh√°r</span>

Yunnan.<a class="noteref" id="n501.8src" href="#n501.8" name="n501.8src">66</a> The strange confusion which Rashid-ud-din makes
between the surroundings of Yunnan and of Pesh√°war is perhaps
due to the fact that in his time the connection between the two places
was still known and admitted.<a class="noteref" id="n501.9src" href="#n501.9" name="n501.9src">67</a> A further trace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>

Chaganjang of Yunnan occurs south-east in the Anin or Honli whose name
suggests the H&uacute;&#7751;as and whose fondness for silver ornaments
at once distinguishes them from their neighbours and connects them with
India.<a class="noteref" id="n502.1src" href="#n502.1" name="n502.1src">68</a> Even though these traces may be accepted as
confirming a possible migration of H&uacute;&#7751;as and Kedaras to
Yunnan and Anin a considerable gap remains between Anin and Angkor.
Three local Cambodian considerations go some way to fill this gap. The
first is that unlike the Siamese and Cochin Chinese the Khmers are a
strong well made race with very little trace of the Mongoloid, with a
language devoid of the intonations of other Indo-Chinese dialects, and
with the hair worn cropped except the top-knot. The second point is
that the Khmers claim a northern origin; and the third that important
architectural remains similar to Nakhonwat are found within Siam limits
about sixty miles north of Angkor.<a class="noteref" id="n502.2src"
href="#n502.2" name="n502.2src">69</a> One further point has to be
considered: How far is an origin from White H&uacute;&#7751;as and
Ked√°ras in agreement with the N√°ga phase of Cambodian
worship. Hiuen Tsiang&rsquo;s details of the Tarim Oxus and Sw√°t
valleys contain nothing so remarkable as the apparent increase of
Dragon worship. In those countries dragons are rarely mentioned by Fa
Hian in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;400: dragons seem to have had
somewhat more importance in the eyes of Sung-Yun in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;520; and to Hiuen Tsiang, the champion of the
Mah√°y√°na or Broadway, dragons are everywhere explaining
all misfortunes earthquakes storms and diseases. Buddhism may be the
state religion but the secret of luck lies in pleasing the
Dragon.<a class="noteref" id="n502.3src" href="#n502.3" name="n502.3src">70</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503"

Appendix IV.<br>
<span class="sc">Cambodia.</span></span> This apparent increased
importance of dragon or N√°ga worship in north-west India during

Hiuen Tsiang. Still so marked an increase makes it probable that with
some of the great fifth and sixth century conquerors of Baktria
K√°bul and the Panj√°b, of whom a trace may remain in the
snake-worshipping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504"

<span class="sc">Cambodia.</span></span> N√°gas and Takkas of the
Kamaon and Garhwal hills, the Dragon was the chief object of worship.
Temple remains show that the seventh and eighth century rulers of
Kashmir, with a knowledge of classic architecture probably brought from
beyond the Indus, were N√°ga worshippers.<a class="noteref" id="n504.1src" href="#n504.1" name="n504.1src">72</a> The fact that the
ninth century revision of religion in Tibet came mainly from Kashmir
and that among the eighteen chief gods of the reformed faith the great
Serpent had a place favours the view that through Tibet passed the
scheme and the classic details of the Kashmir N√°ga temples which
in greater wealth and splendour are repeated in the Nakhonwat of Angkor
in Cambodia.<a class="noteref" id="n504.2src" href="#n504.2" name="n504.2src">73</a> It is true that the dedication of the great temple
to N√°ga worship before the Siamese priests filled it with
statues of Buddha is questioned both by Lieut. Garnier and by Sir H.
Yule.<a class="noteref" id="n504.3src" href="#n504.3" name="n504.3src">74</a> In spite of this objection and though some of the
series have been Buddhist from the first, it is difficult to refuse
acceptance to Mr. Fergusson&rsquo;s conclusions that in the great
N√°khon, all traces of Buddhism are additions. The local
conditions and the worshipful Tale Sap lake favour this conclusion.
What holier dragon site can be imagined than the great lake Tale Sap,
100 miles by 30, joined to the river Mekong by a huge natural channel
which of itself empties the lake in the dry season and refills it
during the rains giving a water harvest of fish as well as a land
harvest of grain. What more typical work of the dragon as guardian
water lord. Again not far off <span class="corr" id="xd25e41668" title="Source: betwen">between</span> Angkor and Yunn√°n was the
head-quarters of the dragon as the unsquared fiend. In Carrajan ten
days west of the city of Yachi Marco Polo (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1290) found a land of snakes and great serpents
ten paces in length with very great heads, eyes bigger than a loaf of
bread, mouths garnished with pointed teeth able to swallow a man whole,
two fore-legs with claws for feet and bodies equal in bulk to a great
cask. He adds: &lsquo;These serpents devour the cubs of lions and bears
without the sire and dam being able to prevent it. Indeed if they catch
the big ones they devour them too: no one can make any resistance.
Every man and beast stands in fear and trembling of them.&rsquo; Even
in these fiend dragons was the sacramental guardian element. The gall
from their inside healed the bite of a mad dog, delivered a woman in
hard labour, and cured itch or it might be worse. Moreover, he
concludes, the flesh of these serpents is excellent eating and
toothsome.<a class="noteref" id="n504.4src" href="#n504.4" name="n504.4src">75</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505"

(Ancient Geography, 43 and Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist Records, I. 109 note
92) the site of <b>Hastinagara</b> or the eight cities is on the
Sw√°t river eighteen miles north of Pesh√°war. In Vedic and
early Mah√°bh√°rata times Hastinapura was the capital of
Gandh√°ra (Hewitt <abbr title="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">Jour. Roy. As. Soc.</abbr> XXI.
217). In the seventh century it was called Pushkal√°vat&iacute;.
(Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist Records, I. 109.) <b>Taxila</b>, the capital of
the country east of the Indus, was situated about forty miles east of
Attok at Sh√°hderi near K√°laka-sarai (Cunningham&rsquo;s
Ancient Geography, 105). According to Cunningham (Ditto 109), Taxila
continued a great city from the time of Alexander till the fifth
century after Christ. It was then laid waste apparently by the great
White H&uacute;&#7751;a conqueror <span class="corr" id="xd25e40465"
title="Source: Mihirak&#363;la">Mihirakula</span> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;500&ndash;550). A hundred years later when Hiuen
Tsiang visited it the country was under Kashmir, the royal family were
extinct, and the nobles were struggling for power (Beal&rsquo;s
Buddhist Records, I. 136). <b>Rumadesa</b>. References to Rumadesa
occur in the traditions of Siam and Cambodia as well as in those of
Java. Fleets of R&uacute;m are also noted in the traditions of Bengal
and Orissa as attacking the coast (Fergusson&rsquo;s Architecture, III.
640). Coupling the mention of R&uacute;m with the tradition that the
Cambodian temples were the work of Alexander the Great Colonel Yule
(<abbr title="Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica">Ency. Brit.</abbr> Article
Cambodia) takes R&uacute;m in its Musalm√°n sense of Greece or
Asia Minor. The variety of references suggested to Fergusson
(Architecture, III. 640) that these exploits are a vague memory of
Roman commerce in the Bay of Bengal. But the Roman rule was that no
fleet should pass east of Ceylon (Reinaud <abbr title=" Journal Asiatique">Jour. As.</abbr> <abbr title="Series">Ser.</abbr>
VI. <abbr title="Tome">Tom.</abbr> I. page 322). This rule may
occasionally have been departed from as in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;166 when the emperor Marcus Aurelius sent an
ambassador by sea to China. Still it seems unlikely that Roman commerce
in the Bay of Bengal was ever active enough to gain a place as settler
and coloniser in the traditions of Java and Cambodia. It was with the
west not with the east of India that the relations of Rome were close
and important. From the time of Mark Antony to the time of Justinian,
that is from about <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;30 to <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;550, their political importance as allies against
the Parthians and Sassanians and their commercial importance as
controllers of one of the main trade routes between the east and the
west made the friendship of the Kush√°ns or &#346;akas who held
the Indus valley and Baktria a matter of the highest importance to
Rome. How close was the friendship is shown in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;60 by the Roman General Corbulo escorting the
Hyrkanian ambassadors up the Indus and through the territories of the
Kush√°ns or Indo-Skythians on their return from their embassy to
Rome. (Compare Rawlinson&rsquo;s Parthia, 271.) The close connection is
shown by the accurate details of the Indus valley and Baktria recorded
by Ptolemy (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;166) and about a hundred
years later (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247) by the author of
the Periplus and by the special value of the gifts which the Periplus
notices were set apart for the rulers of Sindh. One result of this long
continued alliance was the gaining by the Kush√°n and other
rulers of <span class="corr" id="xd25e40506" title="Source: Peshawar">Pesh√°war</span> and the Panj√°b of a
knowledge of Roman coinage astronomy and architecture. Certain
Afgh√°n or Baktrian coins bear the word Roma apparently the name
of some Afgh√°n city. In spite of this there seems no reason to
suppose that Rome attempted to overlord the north-west of India still
less that any local ruler was permitted to make use of the great name
of Rome. It seems possible that certain notices of the fleets of
R&uacute;m in the Bay of Bengal refer to the fleets of the Arab Al-Rami
that is Lambri or north-west Sumatra apparently the Romania of the
Chaldean breviary of the Malab√°r Coast. (Yule&rsquo;s Cathay, I.

Fergusson writes (Architecture, III. 644&ndash;648): The style and
character of the sculptures of the great temple of Boro Buddor are
nearly identical with those of the later caves of Ajanta, on the
Western Gh√°ts, and in S√°lsette. The resemblance in style
is almost equally close with the buildings of Takht-i-Bahi in

(page 637) he says: The Hindu immigrants into Java came from the west
coast of India. They came from the valley of the Indus not from the
valley of the Ganges. Once more, in describing No. XXVI. of the Ajanta
caves Messrs. Fergusson and Burgess (Rock-cut Temples, 345 note 1)
write: The execution of these figures is so nearly the same as in the
Boro Buddor temple in Java that both must have been the work of the
same artists during the latter half of the seventh century or somewhat
later. The Buddhists were not in Java in the fifth century. They must
have begun to go soon after since there is a considerable local element
in the Boro Buddor.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n491.4src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id="n491.5"
href="#n491.5src" name="n491.5">11</a></span> Traditions of expeditions
by sea to Java remain in M√°rw√°r. In April 1895 a bard at
Bhinm√°l related how Bhojr√°ja of Ujjain in anger with his
son Chandrabau drove him away. The son went to a Gujar√°t or
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a port obtained ships and sailed to
Java. He took with him as his Br√°hman the son of a Magh Pandit.
A second tale tells how Vikram the redresser of evils in a dream saw a
Javanese woman weeping, because by an enemy&rsquo;s curse her son had
been turned into stone. Vikram sailed to Java found the woman and
removed the curse. According to a third legend Chandraw√°n the
grandson of Vir Pram√°r saw a beautiful woman in a dream. He
travelled everywhere in search of her. At last a Rishi told him the
girl lived in Java. He started by sea and after many dangers and
wonders found the dream-girl in Java. The people of Bhinm√°l are

summarise the available evidence of Gujar√°t Hindu enterprise by
sea. According to the Greek writers, though it is difficult to accept
their statements as free from exaggeration, when, in <span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;325, Alexander passed down the Indus the river
showed no trace of any trade by sea. If at that time sea trade at the
mouth of the Indus was so scanty as to escape notice it seems fair to
suppose that Alexander&rsquo;s ship-building and fleet gave a start to
deep-sea sailing which the constant succession of strong and vigorous
northern tribes which entered and ruled Western India during the
centuries before and after the Christian era continued to
develope.<a class="noteref" id="n492.3.asrc" href="#n492.3.a" name="n492.3.asrc">15</a> According to Vincent (Periplus, I. 25, 35, 254) in
the time of Agatharcides (<span class="sc">b.c.</span>&nbsp;200) the
ports of Arabia and Ceylon were entirely in the hands of the people of
Gujar√°t. During the second century after Christ, when, under the
great Rudrad√°man (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;143&ndash;158), the Sinh or Kshatrapa dynasty of
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a was at the height of its power,
Indians of Tient&ccedil;o, that is Sindhu, brought presents by sea to
China (Journal Royal Asiatic Society for January 1896 page 9). In
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;166 (perhaps the same as the
preceding) the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius sent by sea to China
ambassadors with ivory rhinoceros&rsquo; horn and other articles
apparently the produce of Western India (DeGuignes&rsquo; Huns, I.
[Part I.] 32). In the third century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;247 the Periplus (McCrindle, 17, 52, 64, 96, 109)
notices large Hindu ships in the east African Arab and Persian ports
and Hindu settlements on the north coast of Sokotra. About a century
later occurs the doubtful reference (Wilford in Asiatic Researches, IX.
224) to the Diveni or pirates of Diu who had to send hostages to
Constantine the Great (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;320&ndash;340)
one of whom was Theophilus afterwards a Christian bishop. Though it
seems probable that the Kshatrapas (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;70&ndash;400) ruled by sea as well as by land
fresh seafaring energy seems to have marked the arrival on the Sindh
and K√°thi√°v√°&#7693; coasts of the Juan-Juan or
Avars (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;390&ndash;450) and of the
White H&uacute;&#7751;as (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;450&ndash;550). During the fifth and sixth
centuries the ports of Sindh and Gujar√°t appear among the chief
centres of naval enterprise in the east. How the sea ruled the religion
of the newcomers is shown by the fame which gathered round the new or
revised gods &#346;iva the Poseidon of Somn√°th and <span class="corr" id="xd25e40686" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> the Apollo or St. Nicholas
of Dw√°rka. (Compare Tod&rsquo;s Annals of
R√°jasth√°n, I. 525.) In the fifth century (Yule&rsquo;s
Cathay, I. lxxviii.) according to Hamza of Ispah√°n, at Hira near
Kufa on the Euphrates the ships of India and China were constantly
moored. In the early sixth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;518&ndash;519) a Persian ambassador went by sea
to China (Ditto, I. lxxiv.) About the same time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;526) Cosmas (Ditto, I. clxxviii.) describes
Sindhu or Debal and Orhota that is Soratha or Ver√°val as leading
places of trade with Ceylon. In the sixth century, apparently driven
out by the White H&uacute;&#7751;as and the Mihiras, the Jats from the
Indus and Kachh occupied the islands in the Bahrein gulf, and perhaps
manned the fleet with which about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;570
Naushirav√°n the great Sassanian (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;531&ndash;574) is said to have invaded the lower
Indus and perhaps Ceylon.<a class="noteref" id="n492.3.a2src" href="#n492.3.a2" name="n492.3.a2src">16</a> About the same time (Fergusson
Architecture, III. 612) Amr√°vati at the <span class="corr" id="xd25e40746" title="Source: Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> mouth
was superseded as the port for the Golden Chersonese by the direct
voyage from Gujar√°t and the west coast of India. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;630 Hiuen Tsiang (Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist Records,
II. 269) describes the people of <span class="corr" id="xd25e40752"
title="Source: Sur√°shtra">Sur√°sh&#7789;ra</span> as
deriving their livelihood from the sea, engaging in commerce, and
exchanging commodities. He further notices that in the chief cities of
Persia Hindus were settled enjoying the full practice of their religion
(Reinaud&rsquo;s Abulfeda, ccclxxxv.) That the Jat not the Arab was the
moving spirit in the early (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;637&ndash;770) Muhammadan sea raids against the
Gujar√°t and Konkan coasts is made probable by the fact that
these seafaring ventures began not in Arabia but in the Jat-settled
shores of the Persian Gulf, that for more than fifty years the Arab
heads of the state forbad them, and that in the Mediterranean where
they had no Jat element the Arab was powerless at sea. (Compare Elliot,
I. 416, 417.) That during the seventh and eighth centuries when the
chief migrations by sea from Gujar√°t to Java and Cambodia seem
to have taken place, Chinese fleets visited Diu (Yule&rsquo;s Cathay,
lxxix.), and that in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;759 Arabs and
Persians besieged Canton and pillaged the storehouses going and
returning by sea (DeGuignes&rsquo; Huns, I. [Pt. II.] 503) suggest that
the Jats were pilots as well as pirates.<a class="noteref" id="n492.3.bsrc" href="#n492.3.b" name="n492.3.bsrc">17</a> On the Sindh
Kachh and Gujar√°t coasts besides the Jats several of the
new-come northern tribes showed notable energy at sea. It is to be
remembered that as detailed in the Statistical Account of Th√°na
(Bombay Gazetteer, XIII. Part II. 433) this remarkable outburst of sea
enterprise may have been due not only to the vigour of the new-come
northerners but to the fact that some of them, perhaps the famous
iron-working Turks (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;580&ndash;680),
brought with them the knowledge of the magnet, and that the local
Br√°hman, with religious skill and secrecy, shaped the bar into a
divine fish-machine or <i>machiyantra</i>, which, floating in a basin
of oil, he consulted in some private quarter of the ship and when the
stars were hid guided the pilot in what direction to steer. Among new
seafaring classes were, on the Makr√°n and Sindh coasts the
Bodhas Kerks and Meds and along the shores of Kachh and
K√°thi√°v√°&#7693;a the closely connected Meds and
Gurjjaras. In the seventh and eighth centuries the Gurjjaras, chiefly
of the Ch√°pa or Ch√°va&#7693;√° clan, both in
Dw√°rka and Somn√°th and also inland, rose to power, a
change which, as already noticed, may explain the efforts of the Jats
to settle along the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. About <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;740 the <span class="corr" id="xd25e40779" title="Source: Ch√°p√°s">Ch√°pas</span> or

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;806&ndash;841) made great efforts to
put down piracy. Yogar√°ja&rsquo;s sons plundered some Bengal or
Bot ships which stress of weather forced into Ver√°val. The king
said &lsquo;My sons with labour we were raising ourselves to be
Ch√°va&#7693;√°s of princely rank; your greed throws us
back on our old nickname of Choras or thieves.&rsquo; Yogar√°ja
refused to be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre. Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd25e40792" title="Source: Bhagvanl√°l&rsquo;s">Bhagv√°nl√°l&rsquo;s</span>

efforts to put down piracy seem to have driven large bodies of Jats
from the Gujar√°t coasts. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;834&ndash;35, according to Ibn Alathyr
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;834), a fleet manned by Djaths or
Jats made a descent on the Tigris. The whole strength of the
Khil√°fat had to be set in motion to stop them. Those who fell
into the hands of the Moslems were sent to Anararbe on the borders of
the Greek empire (Renaud&rsquo;s Fragments, 201&ndash;2). As in the
legend, the Ch√°va&#7693;√° king&rsquo;s sons, that is the
Chauras Mers and Gurjjaras, proved not less dangerous pirates than the
Jats whom they had driven out.<a class="noteref" id="n492.3.a3src"

centuries the Gujar√°t kingdom which had been established in Java
was at the height of its power. (Ditto, Abulfeda, ccclxxxviii.) Early
in the tenth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;915&ndash;930)
Masudi (Yule&rsquo;s Marco Polo, II. 344; Elliot, I. 65) describes
Sokotra as a noted haunt of the Indian corsairs called Baw√°rij
which chase Arab ships bound for India and China. The merchant fleets
of the early tenth century were not Arab alone. The Chauras of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e40827" title="Source: Anahilav√°&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav√°&#7693;a</span>
sent fleets to Bhot and Chin (R√°s M√°la, I. 11). Nor were
Mers and Chauras the only pirates. Towards the end of the tenth century

known in story as Graharipu the Ahir of Sorath and Girn√°r, so

from their boats called <i>behra</i> or <i>bira</i>, were Meds a
seafaring people of Kachh and of Somn√°th a great place of call
for merchants trading between Sofala in east Africa and China. About

keep order at sea. In <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1290 Marco Polo
(Yule&rsquo;s Ed. II. 325, 328, 341) found the people of Gujar√°t
the most desperate pirates in existence. More than a hundred corsair
vessels went forth every year taking their wives and children with them
and staying out the whole summer. They joined in fleets of twenty to
thirty and made a sea cordon five or six miles apart. Sokotra was
infested by multitudes of Hindu pirates who encamped there and put up
their plunder to sale. Ibn Batuta (in Elliot, I. 344&ndash;345) fifty
years later makes the same complaint. Musalm√°n ascendancy had
driven R√°jput chiefs to the coast and turned them into pirates.
The most notable addition was the Gohils who under Mokher√°ji
Gohil, from his castle on Piram island, ruled the sea till his power
was broken by Muhammad Tughlak in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1345 (R√°s M√°la, I. 318). Before

125. The statement that Naushirav√°n received Kar√°chi from
the king of Seringdip (Elliot&rsquo;s History, I. 407: Tabari, II. 221)
throws doubt on this expedition to Ceylon. At the close of the sixth
century Kar√°chi or Diul Sindhi cannot have been in the gift of
the king of Ceylon. It was in the possession of the
S√°har√°i kings of Aror in Upper Sindh perhaps of
Sh√°hi Tegin Devaja shortened to Shahindev. (Compare Cunningham

200. The traders of Chorw√°r, that is of the old Chaura or
Ch√°pa country near Vir√°val and Mangrul, are now known in
Bombay as Ch√°padias. The received explanation of Ch√°padia
is the roofed men it is said in derisive allusion to their large and
heavy headdress. But as the Porbandar headdress is neither specially
large nor ungraceful the common explanation can be hardly more than a
pun. This suggests that the name Ch√°padia is a trace of the
early Ch√°pa tribe of Gurjjaras who also gave their name to
Ch√°panir. Tod&rsquo;s (Western India, 250, 256) description of

this it is to be noted (Ditto ditto) that nagara city corrupts locally
into Angkor. Nagara therefore can hardly also be the origin of the
local Nakhon. Farther as the local Buddhists claim the temple for
Buddha they were bound to find in Nakhon some source other than its

a dragon chapel (Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist Records, I. 40) of which a
white-eared dragon was the patron. The dragon, he notes, gives
seasonable showers and keeps off all plagues and calamities. At the end
of the rains the dragon turns into a little white-eared serpent and the
priests feed him. At the deserted Kapilavastu in Tirhut Fa Hian was
shown a tank and in it a dragon who, he says, constantly guards and
protects a tower to Buddha and worships there night and morning (Ditto,
I. 50).</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Sung-Yun (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;519) notices (Beal&rsquo;s Buddhist Records, I.
69) in Sw√°t (Udy√°na) a tank and a temple with fifty
priests called the temple of the N√°ga R√°ja because the
N√°ga supplies it with funds. In another passage (Ditto, 92) he
notices that in a narrow land on the border of Posse (Fars) a dragon
had taken his residence and was stopping the rain and piling the snow.
Hiuen Tsiang (Ditto, I. 20) notes that in Kucha, north of the Tarim
river east of the Bolor mountains, the Shen horses are half dragon
horses and the Shen men half dragon men. In Aksu, 150 miles west of
Kucha, fierce dragons molest travellers with storms of flying sand and
gravel (Ditto, 25); the hot lake or Johai, 100 miles north-east of
Aksu, is jointly inhabited by dragons and fish; scaly monsters rise to
the surface and travellers pray to them (Ditto, 26). An Arhat (page 63)
prays that he may become a N√°gar√°ja. He becomes a
N√°gar√°ja, kills the real N√°gar√°ja, takes
his palace, attaches the N√°gas to him, and raises winds and
tempests; Kanishka comes against him and the Arhat takes the form of a
Br√°hman and knocks down Kanishka&rsquo;s towers. A great
merit-flame bursts from Kanishka&rsquo;s shoulders and the
Br√°hman N√°gar√°ja apologises. His evil and
passionate spirit, the fruit of evil deeds in a former birth, had made
the Arhat pray to be a N√°gar√°ja. If clouds gathered the
monks knew that the N√°gar√°ja meant mischief. The convent
gong was beaten and the N√°gar√°ja pacified (or scared)
Ditto, 64&ndash;66. N√°gas were powerful brutes, cloud-riding
wind-driving water-walking brutes, still only brutes. The account of
the N√°ga or dragon of Jelal√°b√°d (in Kambojia) is
excellent. In Buddha&rsquo;s time the dragon had been Buddha&rsquo;s
milkman. He lost his temper, laid flowers at the Dragon&rsquo;s cave,
prayed he might become a dragon, and leaped over the cliff. He laid the
country waste and did so much harm that Tath√°gata (or Buddha)
converted him. The N√°ga asked Buddha to take his cave. Buddha
said No. I will leave my shadow. If you get angry look at my shadow and
it will quiet you (Ditto, 94). Another typical dragon is Apal√°la
of the Sw√°t river (Ditto, 68). In the time of Ka&#347;yapa
Buddha Apal√°la was a weaver of spells named Gangi. Gangi&rsquo;s
spells kept the dragons quiet and saved the crops. But the people were
thankless and paid no tithes. May I be born a dragon, cursed Gangi,
poisonous and ruinous. He was born the dragon of the Sw√°t
valley, Apal√°la, who belched forth a salt stream and burned the
crops. The ruin of the fair and pious valley of Sw√°t reached
&#346;akya&rsquo;s (Buddha&rsquo;s) ears. He passed to Mangala and beat
the mountain side with Indra&rsquo;s mace. Apal√°la came forth
was lectured and converted. He agreed to do no more mischief on
condition that once in twelve years he might ruin the crops. (Ditto,
122.) In a lake about seven miles west of Taksha&#347;il√°, a
spot dear to the exiled Kambojan, lived El√°patra the
N√°gar√°ja, a Bhikshu or ascetic who in a former life had
destroyed a tree. When the crops wanted rain or fair weather, the
Shamans or medicine-men led the people to pray at
El√°patra&rsquo;s tank (page 137). In Kashmir, perhaps the place
of halt of the Kambojan in his conquests eastwards, in old times the
country was a dragon lake.<a class="noteref" id="n502.3.asrc" href="#n502.3.a" name="n502.3.asrc">71</a> Madhyantika drove out the waters
but left one small part as a house for the N√°ga king (I. 150).
What sense have these tales? In a hilly land where the people live in
valleys the river is at once the most whimsical and the most dangerous
force. Few seasons pass in which the river does not either damage with
its floods or with its failure and at times glaciers and landslips stop
the entire flow and the valley is ruined. So great and so strange an
evil as the complete drying of a river must be the result of some
one&rsquo;s will, of some one&rsquo;s temper. The Dragon is angry he
wants a sacrifice. Again the river ponds into a lake, the lake tops the
earth bank and rushes in a flood wasting as only a dragon can waste.
For generations after so awful a proof of power all doubts regarding
dragons are dead. (Compare Drew&rsquo;s Cashmere and Jummoo,
414&ndash;421.) In India the Chinese dragon turns into a cobra. In
China the cobra is unknown: in India than the cobra no power is more
dreaded. How can the mighty unwieldy dragon be the little silent cobra.
How not? Can the dragon be worshipful if he is unable to change his
shape. To the spirit not to the form is worship due. Again the
worshipped dragon becomes the guardian. The great earth Bodhisattva
transforms himself into a N√°gar√°ja and dwells in lake
Anavatapta whose flow of cool water enriches the world (Buddhist
Records, II. 11). In a fane in Sw√°t Buddha takes the form of a
dragon and the people live on him (125). A pestilence wasted
Sw√°t. Buddha becomes the serpent Suma, all who taste his flesh
are healed of the plague (126). A N√°ga maiden, who for her sins
has been born in serpent shape and lives in a pool, loves Buddha who
was then a &#346;akya chief. Buddha&rsquo;s merit regains for the girl
her lost human form. He goes into the pool slays the girl&rsquo;s
snake-kin and marries her. Not even by marriage with the &#346;akya is
her serpent spirit driven out of the maiden. At night from her head
issues a nine-crested N√°ga. &#346;akya strikes off the nine
crests and ever since that blow the royal family has suffered from
headaches (132). This last tale shows how Buddhism works on the coarser
and fiercer tribes who accept its teaching. The converts rise to be men
though a snake-head may peep out to show that not all of the old leaven
is dead. In other stories Buddha as the sacramental snake shows the
moral advance in Buddhism from fiend to guardian worship. The rest of
the tales illustrate the corresponding intellectual progress from force
worship to man, that is mind, worship. The water force sometimes kindly
and enriching sometimes fierce and wasting becomes a Bodhisattva always
kindly though his goodwill may have to give way to the rage of evil
powers. So Br√°hmanism turns N√°r√°yana the sea into
&#346;iva or Somn√°th the sea ruler. In this as in other phases
religion passes from the worship of the forces of Nature to which in
his beginnings man has to bow to the worship of Man or conscious Mind
whose growth in skill and in knowledge has made him the Lord of the
forces. These higher ideals are to a great extent a veneer. The
Buddhist evangelist may dry the lake; he is careful to leave a pool for
the N√°gar√°ja. In times of trouble among the fierce
struggles of pioneers and settlers the spirit of Buddha withdraws and
leaves the empty shrine to the earlier and the more immortal spirit of
Force, the N√°gar√°ja who has lived on in the pool which
for the sake of peace Buddha refrained from drying.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n502.3src">&uarr;</a></p>

<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;600 and 1200 and allots

mistaken. The shafts are fluted Grecian Doric probably taken from the
Gandh√°ra monasteries of the fourth and fifth centuries.
Fergusson was satisfied (Ditto, 289) that the religion of the builders
of the K√°shmir temples was N√°ga worship. In Cambodia the
Br√°hman remains were like those of Java (Ditto, 667). But the
connection between the Nakhonwat series and the K√°shmir temples
was unmistakeable (Ditto, 297, 665). N√°ga worship was the object
of both (Ditto, 677&ndash;679). Imperfect information forced Fergusson
to date the Nakhonwat not earlier than the thirteenth century (Ditto,
660, 679). The evidence of the inscriptions which (J. As. Ser. VI. Tom.
XIX. page 190) brings back the date of this the latest of a long series
of temples to the ninth and tenth centuries adds greatly to the
probability of some direct connection between the builders of the

Somn√°th and its temple. He calls it a celebrated city of India
situated on the shore of the sea and washed by its waves. Among its
wonders is Somn√°th, an idol hung in space resting on nothing. In
Somn√°th he says Hindus assemble by the ten thousand at lunar
eclipses, believing that the souls of men meet there after separation
from the body and that at the will of the idol they are re-born into
other animals. The two centuries since its destruction by the
idol-breaker of Ghaznah had restored Somn√°th to its ancient
prosperity. He concludes his account of Somn√°th by telling how
Mahm&uacute;d ascertained that the chief idol was of iron and its
canopy a loadstone and how by removing one of the walls the idol fell
to the ground.</p>

the worship of these emblems abounds. A jar of Ganges water and a
basket of Kashmir flowers were brought daily to Somn√°th. Its
worshippers believed the stone to possess the power of curing all

href="#n522.4" name="n522.4src">174</a> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1121) gives a detailed account of the temple of
Somn√°th and its ancient grandeur. He says Somn√°th was the
greatest of all the idols of Hind. Pilgrims by the hundred thousand met
at the temple especially at the times of eclipses and believed that the
ebb and flow of the tide was the homage paid by the sea to the god.
Everything of the most precious was brought to Somn√°th and the
temple was endowed with more than 10,000 villages. Jewels of
incalculable value were stored in the temple and to wash the idol water
from the sacred stream of the Ganga was brought every day over a
distance of two hundred <i>farsangs</i> (1200 miles). A thousand
Br√°hmans were on duty every day in the temple, three hundred and
fifty singers and dancers performed before the image, and three hundred
barbers shaved the pilgrims who intended to pay their devotions at the
shrine. Every one of these servants had a settled allowance. The temple
of Somn√°th was built upon fifty pillars of teakwood covered with
lead. The idol, which did not appear to be sculptured,<a class="noteref" id="n522.5src" href="#n522.5" name="n522.5src">175</a> stood
three cubits out of the ground and had a girth of three cubits. The
idol was by itself in a dark chamber lighted by most exquisitely
jewelled chandeliers. Near the idol was a chain of gold to which bells
were hung weighing 200 <i>mans</i>. The chain was shaken at certain
intervals during the night that the bells might rouse fresh parties of
worshipping Br√°hmans. The treasury containing many gold and
silver idols, with doors hung with curtains set with valuable jewels,
was near the chamber of the idol. The worth of what was found in the
temple exceeded two millions of <i>d&iacute;n√°rs</i>
(<abbr title="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 1,00,00,000). According to Ibni
As&iacute;r Mahm&uacute;d reached Somn√°th on a Thursday in the
middle of <i>Zilka√°da</i> H. 414 (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;December 1023). On the approach of Mahm&uacute;d
Bh&iacute;m the ruler of Anhilv√°&#7693; fled abandoning his
capital and took refuge in a fort to prepare for war. From
Anhilv√°&#7693; Mahm&uacute;d started for Somn√°th taking
several forts with images which, Ibni As&iacute;r says, were the
heralds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name="pb523">523</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Resuming his march he crossed a desert with little water. Here he was
encountered by an army of 20,000 fighting men under chiefs who had
determined not to submit to the invader. These forces were defeated and
put to flight by a detachment sent against them by Mahm&uacute;d.
Mahm&uacute;d himself marched to Dabalw√°rah a place said by Ibni
As&iacute;r to be two days journey from Somn√°th. When he reached
Somn√°th Mahm&uacute;d beheld a strong fortress whose base was
washed by the waves of the sea. The assault began on the next day
Friday. During nearly two days of hard fighting the invaders seemed
doomed to defeat. On the third the Musalm√°ns drove the Hindus
from the town to the temple. A terrible carnage took place at the
temple-gate. Those of the defenders that survived took themselves to
the sea in boats but were overtaken and some slain and the rest

in the overlordship of the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as in
Gujar√°t that Al Idr&iacute;si (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1100, but probably quoting Al Jauhari
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;950) describes Nehrwalla as the
capital of the Balar√°s. Until Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd25e44458" title="Source: Bh√°nd√°rkar">Bhand√°rkar</span> discovered
its origin in Vallabha, the ease with which meanings could be tortured
out of the word and in Gujar√°t its apparent connection with the
Valabhi kings (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;509&ndash;770) made
the word Balar√°i a cause of matchless confusion.<a class="noteref" id="n525.6src" href="#n525.6" name="n525.6src">196</a></p>
<p>The merchant Sulaim√°n (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;851)
ranks the Balh√°ra, the lord of M√°nk&iacute;r, as the
fourth of the great rulers of the world. Every prince in India even in
his own land paid him homage. He was the owner of many elephants and of
great wealth. He refrained from wine and paid his troops and servants
regularly. Their favour to Arabs was famous. Abu Zaid (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;913) says that though the Indian kings
acknowledge the supremacy of no one, yet the Balh√°ras or

by virtue of the title Balh√°ra are kings of kings. Ibni
Khurd√°dbah (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;912) describes the
Balh√°ras as the greatest of Indian kings being as the name
imports the king of kings. Al Mas&uacute;di (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;915) described Balh√°ra as a dynastic name
which he who followed took. Though he introduces two other potentates
the king of Jurz and the Ba&ucirc;ra or Parm√°r king of Kanauj
fighting with each other and with the Balh√°ra he makes the
Balh√°ra, the lord of the M√°nk&iacute;r or the great
centre, the greatest king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526" href="#pb526" name="pb526">526</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

Balh√°ra favours and honours Musalm√°ns and allows them to
have mosques and assembly mosques. When Al Mas&uacute;di was in Cambay
the town was ruled by B√°nia, the deputy of the Balh√°ra.
Al Istakhri (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;951) describes the land
from Kamb√°yah to Saim&uacute;r (Cheul) as the land of the
Balh√°ra of M√°nk&iacute;r. In the Konkan were many
Musalm√°ns over whom the Balh√°ra appointed no one but a
Musalm√°n to rule. Ibni Haukal (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;970) describes the Balh√°ra as holding sway
over a land in which are several Indian kings.<a class="noteref" id="n526.2src" href="#n526.2" name="n526.2src">198</a> Al Idr&iacute;si
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1100 but quoting Al Jauhari
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;950) agrees with Ibni
Khurd√°dbah that Balh√°ra is a title meaning King of Kings.
He says the title is hereditary in this country, where when a king
ascends the throne he takes the name of his predecessor and transmits
it to his heirs.<a class="noteref" id="n526.3src" href="#n526.3" name="n526.3src">199</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Condition.</i></span>That the Arabs
found the R√°sh&#7789;rak&uacute;&#7789;as kind and liberal
rulers there is ample evidence. In their territories property was
secure,<a class="noteref" id="n526.4src" href="#n526.4" name="n526.4src">200</a> theft or robbery was unknown, commerce was
encouraged, foreigners were treated with consideration and respect. The
Arabs especially were honoured not only with a marked and delicate
regard, but magistrates from among themselves were appointed to
adjudicate their disputes according to the Musalm√°n law.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Gurjjaras.</i></span>The ruler next
in importance to the Balh√°ra was the Jurz that is the Gurjjara
king. It is remarkable, though natural, that the Arabs should preserve
the true name of the rulers of Anhilv√°&#7693;a which the three
tribe or dynastic names Ch√°pa or Chaura (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;720&ndash;956), Solan&#775;ki or C√°ulukya
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;961&ndash;1242), and V√°ghela
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;1240&ndash;1290) should so long have
concealed. Sulaim√°n (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;851)
notices that the Jurz king hated Musalm√°ns while the
Balh√°ra king loved Musalm√°ns. He may not have known what
excellent reasons the Gurjjaras had for hating the Arab raiders from
sea and from Sindh. Nor would it strike him that the main reason why
the Balh√°ra fostered the Moslem was the hope of Arab help in his
struggles with the Gurjjaras.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Jurz.</i></span>According to the
merchant Sulaim√°n<a class="noteref" id="n526.5src" href="#n526.5" name="n526.5src">201</a> (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;851) the kingdom next after the
Balh√°ra&rsquo;s was that of Jurz the Gurjjara king whose
territories &ldquo;consisted of a tongue of land.&rdquo; The king of
Jurz maintained a large force: his cavalry was the best in India. He
was unfriendly to the Arabs. His territories were very rich and
abounded in horses and camels. In his realms exchanges were carried on
in silver and gold dust of which metals mines were said to be
worked.</p>
<p>The king of Jurz was at war with the Balh√°ras as well as with
the neighbouring kingdom of T√°fak or the Panj√°b. The
details given under Bh&iacute;nm√°l page 468 show that
Sulaim√°n&rsquo;s tongue of land, by which he apparently meant
either K√°thi√°v√°&#7693; or Gujar√°t was an
imperfect idea of the extent of Gurjjara rule. At the beginning of the
tenth century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;916

the Gurjjara Vatsar√°ja&rsquo;s success in Bengal about a century
before shows not to be impossible. Ibni Khurd√°dbah (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;912) ranks the king of Juzr as fourth in
importance among Indian kings. According to him &ldquo;the
T√°tariya dirhams were in use in the Juzr kingdom.&rdquo; Al
Mas&uacute;di (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;943) speaks of the
Konkan country of the Balh√°ra as on one side exposed to the
attacks of the king of Juzr a monarch rich in men horses and camels. He
speaks of the Juzr kingdom bordering on T√°f√°n apparently
the Panj√°b and T√°f√°n as bounded by Rahma<a class="noteref" id="n527.2src" href="#n527.2" name="n527.2src">203</a>
apparently Burma and Sum√°tra. Ibni Haukal (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;968&ndash;976) notices that several kingdoms
existed, including the domain of the &#346;il√°h√°ras of
the north Konkan within the land of the Balh√°ra between

as fair and handsome and notices that both men and women had their ears
pierced. This description of the people still more the extension of the
country both along the sea and along the continent suggests that
Mas&uacute;di&rsquo;s Al Rahmi is a combination of Burma which by

mosques and J√°m√° mosques Musalm√°n magistrates or

records<a class="noteref" id="n530.2src" href="#n530.2" name="n530.2src">246</a> that in the ninth century (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;581), when the Hindus recovered Sind√°n
(Sanj√°n in Kachh) they spared the assembly mosque where long
after the Faithful congregated on Fridays praying for their
Khal&iacute;fah without hindrance. In the Balh√°ra country so
strongly did the people believe in the power of Isl√°m or which
is perhaps more likely so courteous were they that they said that our
king enjoys a long life and long reign is solely due to the favour
shown by him to the Musalm√°ns. So far as the merchant
Sulaim√°n saw in the ninth century the chief religion in
Gujar√°t was Buddhism. He notices that the principles of the
religion of China were brought from India and that the Chinese ascribe
to the Indians the introduction of Buddhas into their country. Of
religious beliefs metempsychoses or re-birth and of religious practices
widow-burning or <i>satti</i> and self-torture seem to have struck him
most.<a class="noteref" id="n530.3src" href="#n530.3" name="n530.3src">247</a> As a rule the dead were burned.<a class="noteref"

(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;943) a general opinion prevailed
that India was the earliest home of order and wisdom. The Indians chose
as their king the great Br√°hma who ruled them for 366 years. His
descendants retain the name of Br√°hman and are honoured as the
most illustrious caste. They abstain from the flesh of
animals.<a class="noteref" id="n531.1src" href="#n531.1" name="n531.1src">257</a> Hindu kings cannot succeed before the age of forty

Hindus strongly disapprove of the use of wine both in themselves and in

intoxicating and reason-clouding qualities.<a class="noteref" id="n531.3src" href="#n531.3" name="n531.3src">259</a> Al

Idr&iacute;si (end of the eleventh century) closely follows Ibni
Khurd√°dbah&rsquo;s (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;912)
division of the people of India. The chief exception is that he
represents<a class="noteref" id="n531.5src" href="#n531.5" name="n531.5src">261</a> the second class, the Br√°hmans, as wearing
the skins of tigers and going about staff in hand collecting crowds and
from morn till eve proclaiming to their hearers the glory and power of
God. He makes out that the Kastari√°s or Kshatriyas are able to
drink three <i>ratl</i> (a <i>ratl</i> being one pound troy) of wine
and are allowed to marry Br√°hman women. The Sabdaliya or Chandal
women, he says, are noted for beauty. Of the forty-two sects he
enumerates worshippers of trees and adorers of serpents, which they
keep in stables and feed as well as they can, deeming it to be a
meritorious work. He says that the inhabitants of Kamb√°ya are
Buddhists (idolators)<a class="noteref" id="n531.6src" href="#n531.6"
name="n531.6src">262</a> and that the Balh√°ra also worships the
idol Buddha.<a class="noteref" id="n531.7src" href="#n531.7" name="n531.7src">263</a> The Indians, says Al Idr&iacute;si<a class="noteref" id="n531.8src" href="#n531.8" name="n531.8src">264</a> (end
of the eleventh century) are naturally inclined to justice and in their
actions never depart from it. Their reputation for good faith, honesty,
and fidelity to their engagements brings strangers flocking to their
country and aids its prosperity. In illustration of the peaceable
disposition of the Hindus, he quotes the ancient practice of
<i>duh√°i</i> or conjuring in the name of the king, a rite which
is still in vogue in some native states. When a man has a rightful
claim he draws a circle on the ground and asks his debtor to step into
the circle in the name of the king. The debtor never fails to step in
nor does he ever leave the circle without paying his debts. Al
Idr&iacute;si describes the people of Nahrw√°ra as having so high
a respect for oxen that when an ox dies they bury it. &ldquo;When
enfeebled by age or if unable to work they provide their oxen with food
without exacting any return.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n531.9src"

dislike for India is described by Al Mas&uacute;di (Mur&uacute;j Arabic
Text, Cairo Edition, III. 166&ndash;171), to have originated from the
description of the country by a philosopher to whom Umar had referred
on the first spread of Isl√°m in his reign. The philosopher said:
India is a distant and remote land peopled by rebellious infidels.
Immediately after the battle of Kadesiah (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;636) when sending out Utbah, his first governor
to the newly-founded camp-town of Basrah Umar is reported to have said:
I am sending thee to the land of Al-Hind (India) as governor. Remember
it is a field of the fields of the enemy. The third Khal&iacute;fah
Usm√°n (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;643&ndash;655) ordered
his governor of Ir√°k to depute a special officer to visit India
and wait upon the Khal&iacute;fah to report his opinion of that
country. His report of India was not encouraging. He said: Its water is
scarce, its fruits are poor, and its robbers bold. If the troops sent
there are few they will be slain; if many they will starve.

Tamraz for Al B&iacute;r&uacute;ni&rsquo;s Arabic form of

eastern hills; it has a south-easterly course till it falls into the
sea near B√°hruch about 60 <i>yojanas</i> to the east of
Somn√°th. The literal translation of the text of Al
B&iacute;r&uacute;ni (see Sachau&rsquo;s Al
B&iacute;r&uacute;ni&rsquo;s India, 130) is that given above: It is
hard to believe that the accurate Al B&iacute;r&uacute;ni while in one
place (see Sachau&rsquo;s Text, 99) giving the name of the Narbada
faultlessly, should in another place fall into the error of tracing it
from <i>Tirmiz</i> a city of Central Asia. A comparison of
Elliot&rsquo;s version with the text sets the difficulty at rest.

from 20 to 25 dirhams or drachmas. As a weight it represented a drachma

9s. or 10 francs to half a sovereign. For an elaborate article on the

to <i>Sulaim√°n</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd25e43582" title="Source: A.C."><span class="sc">a.d.</span></span>&nbsp;851) the
T√°rtariya dirham weighed &ldquo;a dirham and a half of the
coinage of the king.&rdquo; Elliot, I. 3. Al Mas&uacute;di (Prairies
D&rsquo;Or, I. 382) calls these &ldquo;T√°tiriyyah&rdquo;
dirhams, giving them the same weight as that given by
<i>Sulaim√°n</i> to the T√°rtariyah dirhams. <i>Ibni
Haukal</i> calls it the Titari dirhem and makes its weight equal to
&ldquo;a dirham and a third&rdquo; (Elliot, I. 85).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n519.8src">&uarr;</a></p>

Pygmies lived in India in the neighbourhood of the silver mines, which
Lassen places near Udaipur (Mewar). From the description of these
Pygmies (Ph&ocirc;tios. Bibl. LXXII. 11&ndash;12) it is evident that
they represent the Bh&iacute;ls. Kt&ecirc;sias also mentions
(Ph&ocirc;tios. Bibl. LXXII. 8) that there is a place in an uninhabited
region fifteen days from Mount Sardous, where they venerate the sun and
moon and where for thirty-five days in each year the sun remits his
heat for the comfort of his worshippers. This place must apparently
have been somewhere in <span class="corr" id="xd25e45120" title="Source: Marwar">M&acirc;rw&acirc;r</span>, and perhaps Mount &Acirc;bu
is the place referred to.</p>

300&nbsp;<span class="sc">b.c.</span>) who resided with Candragupta as
the ambassador of Seleukos Nikator and wrote an account of India in
four books, of which considerable fragments are preserved, chiefly by
Strabo, Pliny, and Arrian. His general account of the manners of the
Indians relates chiefly to those of northern India, of whom he had
personal knowledge. But he also gave a geographical description of
India, for Arrian informs us (Ind. VII) that he gave the total number
of Indian tribes as 118, and Pliny (VI. 17ff) does in fact enumerate
about 90, to whom may be added some seven or eight more mentioned by
Arrian. It is true that Pliny does not distinctly state that he takes
his geographical details from Megasthen&ecirc;s, and that he quotes
Seneca as having written a book on India. But Seneca also (Pliny, VI.
17) gave the number of the tribes as 118 in which he must have followed
Megasthen&ecirc;s. Further, Pliny says (<i>ibid</i><span class="corr"
id="xd25e45146" title="Not in source">.</span>) that accounts of the
military forces of each nation were given by writers such as
Megasthen&ecirc;s and Dionysius who stayed with Indian kings: and as he
does not mention Dionysius in his list of authorities for his Book VI.,
it follows that it was from Megasthen&ecirc;s that he drew his accounts
of the forces of the Gangarid&aelig;, Modogalinga, Andar&aelig;, Prasi,
Megall&aelig;, Asmagi, Orat&aelig;, Suaratarat&aelig;, Automula,
Charm&aelig;, and Pand&aelig; (VI. 19), names which, as will be shown
below, betray a knowledge of all parts of India. It is a fair inference
that the remaining names mentioned by Pliny were taken by him from
Megasthen&ecirc;s, perhaps through the medium of Seneca&rsquo;s work.

<i>Megasthen&ecirc;s.</i></span> and the fact that Megasthen&ecirc;s
learnt the tribal names in their Prakrit forms, make it extremely
difficult to identify many of the races referred to.</p>
<p>That part of Pliny&rsquo;s account of India which may with some
certainty be traced back to Megasthen&ecirc;s begins with a statement
of the stages of the royal road from the Hypasis (Bi√°s) to
Palibothra (Patna) (Nat. Hist. VI. 17). The next chapter gives an
account of the Ganges and its tributaries and mentions the
Gangarid&aelig; of Kalinga with their capital Pertalis as the most
distant nation on its banks. In the 19th chapter, after an account of
the forces of the Gangarid&aelig;, Pliny gives a list of thirteen
tribes, of which the only ones that can be said to be satisfactorily
identified are Modogalinga (the three Calingas: Caldwell Drav. Gr.),
Molind&aelig; (compare Mount M&acirc;lindya of Var&acirc;ha Mihira Br.
S. XIV.), and Thalut&aelig; (McCrindle reads Taluct&aelig; and
identifies with the T&acirc;mraliptakas of Tamluk on the lower Ganges).
He next mentions the Andar&aelig; (Andhras of Telingana) with thirty
cities 100,000 foot 2000 horse and 1000 elephants. He then digresses to
speak of the Dard&aelig; (Dards of the Upper Indus) as rich in gold and
the Set&aelig; (of M&ecirc;w&acirc;r, Lassen) in silver, and next
introduces the Prasi (Pr&acirc;cyas) of Palibothra (<span class="corr"
id="xd25e45165" title="Source: P&acirc;taliputra">P&acirc;&#7789;aliputra</span>) as the most
famous and powerful of all the tribes, having 600,000 foot 30,000 horse
and 8000 elephants. Inland from these he names the Mon&aelig;des
(Mu&#7751;&#7693;a of Singbh&uacute;m) and Suari (&#346;avaras of
Central India) among whom is Mount Maleus (Mahendra Male?). Then after
some account of the Iomanes (Yamun&acirc;) running between Methora
(Mathur&acirc;) and Chrysobora (McCrindle reads Carisobora, Arrian Ind.
VIII. Kleisobora = K&#7771;ish&#7751;apura?) he turns to the Indus, of
some of whose nineteen tributaries he gives some account in chapter 20.
He then digresses to give an account of the coast of India, starting
from the mouth of the Ganges, whence to Point Calingon (Point
God&acirc;vari) and the city of Dandaguda (Cunningham&rsquo;s
R&acirc;ja Mahendri, but more probably the Dhanaka&#7789;aka or
Dhenuk&acirc;ka&#7789;a of the Western cave inscriptions) he reckons
625 miles. The distance thence to Tropina (Tirupanatara near Kochin
according to Burgess) is 1225 miles. Next at a distance of 750 miles is
the cape of Perimula, where is the most famous mart of India. Further
on in the same chapter is mentioned a city named Automula on the sea
shore among the Arabastr&aelig; (or Salabastr&aelig; and Orat&aelig;,
McCrindle) a noble mart where five rivers together flow into the sea.
There can hardly be a doubt that the two places are the same, the two
names being taken from different authorities, and that the place meant
is Chemula or Cheul (Ptolemy&rsquo;s Simulla) the five rivers being
those that flow into Bombay Harbour northward of Cheul. The distance
from Perimula to the Island of Patala in the Indus is 620 miles. Pliny
next enumerates as hill tribes between the Indus and Jamna, shut in a
ring of mountains and deserts for a space of 625 miles, the C&aelig;si
(the Keki&#7885;i of Arr. Ind. IV. and K&ecirc;kayas of the
Pur&acirc;&#7751;as, about the head waters of the Sutlej), the
Cetriboni of the woods (&hellip; Vana?), the Megall&aelig;
(M&ecirc;kalas) with 500 elephants and unknown numbers of horse and
foot, the Chrysei (Kar&ucirc;sha) Parasang&aelig; (P&acirc;ra&#347;ava,
corrupted by the likeness of its first three syllables to the word
<span class="trans" title="parasanga"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&alpha;</span></span>,
the Asmagi (A&#347;maka of Var&acirc;ha Mihira) with 30,000 foot 300
elephants and 800 horse. These are shut in by the Indus and surrounded
by a circle of mountains and deserts for 625 miles. Next come the Dari
and Sur&aelig; and then deserts again for 187 miles. Whether these are
or are not correctly identified with the Dhars and Saurs of Sindh, they
must be placed somewhere to the north of the Ran. Below them come five
kingless tribes living in the hills along the sea-coast&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534" name="pb534">534</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<span class="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</span><br>
<i>Megasthen&ecirc;s.</i></span> Maltecor&aelig;, Singh&aelig;,
Maroh&aelig;, Rarung&aelig;, and Moruni&mdash;none of whom are
satisfactorily identified, but who may be placed in Kachh. Next follow
the Nare&aelig;, enclosed by Mount Capitalia (&Acirc;bu) the highest
mountain in India, on the other side of which are mines of gold and
silver. The identification of Capitalia with &Acirc;bu is probable
enough, but the name given to the mountain must be connected with the
Kapish&#7789;hala of the <i>Pur&acirc;&#7751;as</i>, who have given
their name to one of the recensions of the Yajur Veda, though Kaithal,
their modern representative, lies far away from &Acirc;bu in the
Karn&acirc;l district of the Panj&acirc;b, and Arrian places his
<span class="trans" title="kambistholoi"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&kappa;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&iota;&sigma;&theta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;</span></span>
(Ind. IV) about the head waters of the Hydra&ocirc;t&ecirc;s
(R&acirc;v&icirc;). After Capitalia and the Nare&aelig; come the
Orat&aelig; with but ten elephants but numerous infantry. These must be
the Apar&acirc;ntakas of the inscriptions and
<i>pur&acirc;&#7751;as</i>, Megasthen&ecirc;s having learnt the name in
a <span class="corr" id="xd25e45205" title="Source: Prak&#7771;it">Pr&acirc;k&#7771;it</span> form (Avar&acirc;ta,
Or&acirc;ta). The name of the next tribe, who have no elephants but
horse and foot only, is commonly read Suaratarat&aelig; (Nobbe) but the
preferable reading is Varetat&aelig; (McCrindle) which when corrected
to Varelat&aelig; represents Varalatta, the sixth of the seven Konkans
in the pur&acirc;&#7751;ic lists (Wilson <abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr> XV. 47), which occupied the centre
of the Th√°na district and the country of the wild tribe of the
Varl&icirc;s. Next are the Odonb&aelig;ores, whose name is connected
with the <i>udumbara</i> Ficus glomerata tree, and who are not the
Audumbari S&acirc;lvas of <span class="corr" id="xd25e45214" title="Source: P&acirc;ni&#7751;i">P&acirc;&#7751;ini</span> (IV. i. 173) but
must be placed in Southern Th√°na. Next come the Arabastr&aelig;
Orat&aelig; (so read for Arabastr&aelig; Thorace of Nobbe, and
Salabastr&aelig; Horat&aelig; of McCrindle) or Arabastra division of
the Orat&aelig; or Kon&#775;ka&#7751;&icirc;s. Arabastra may be
connected with the &Acirc;rava of Var&acirc;ha-Mihira&rsquo;s
South-Western Division (<abbr>Br. S.</abbr> XIV. 17) where they are
mentioned along with Barbara (the seventh or northernmost
Kon&#775;ka&#7751;). This tribe had a fine city in a marsh infested by
crocodiles and also the great mart of Automula (Cheul) at the
confluence of five rivers, and the king had 1600 elephants 150,000 foot
and 5000 horse, and must therefore have held a large part of the Dakhan
as well as of the sea coast. Next to this kingdom is that of the
Charm&aelig;, whose forces are small, and next to them the Pand&aelig;
(P&acirc;&#7751;&#7693;ya of Travancor) with 300 cities 150,000 foot
and 500 elephants. Next follows a list of thirteen tribes, some of
which St. Martin has identified with modern <span class="corr" id="xd25e45221" title="Source: Rajput">R&acirc;jput</span> tribes about
the Indus, because the last name of the thirteen is Orostr&aelig;,
&ldquo;who reach to the island of Patala,&rdquo; and may be confidently
identified with the <span class="corr" id="xd25e45224" title="Source: S&acirc;ur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra">Saur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra</span> of
K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a. We must however assume that
Megasthen&ecirc;s after naming the tribes of the west coast enumerates
the inland tribes of the Dakhan until he arrives at the point from
which he started. But the only identification that seems plausible is
that of the Derang&aelig; with the Telingas or Telugus. Next to the
Orostr&aelig; follows a list of tribes on the east of the Indus from
south to north&mdash;the Matho&aelig; (compare M&acirc;nthava, a
B&acirc;h&icirc;ka town P&acirc;n. IV. ii. 117), Boling&aelig;
(Bh&acirc;ulingi, a S&acirc;lva tribe P&acirc;n. IV. i. 173),
Gallitalut&aelig; (perhaps a corruption of T&acirc;ilakhali, another
S&acirc;lva tribe, <i>ib.</i>), Dimuri, Megari, Ardab&aelig;,
Mes&aelig; (Matsya of Jaipur?), Abi, Suri, (v. 1. Abhis Uri),
Sil&aelig;, and then deserts for 250 miles. Next come three more tribes
and then again deserts, then four or five (according to the reading)
more tribes, and the Asini whose capital is Bucephala (Jal&acirc;lpur)
(Cunningham <abbr title="Ancient Geography">Anc. Geog.</abbr> 177).
Megasthen&ecirc;s then gives two mountain tribes and ten beyond the
Indus including the Orsi (Ura&#347;&acirc;) Taxil&aelig;
(Taksha&#347;il&acirc;) and Peucolit&aelig; (people of
Pushk&acirc;lavat&icirc;). Of the work of D&ecirc;&iuml;machos, who
went on an embassy to Allitrochad&ecirc;s (Bindus&acirc;ra) son of
Candragupta, nothing is known except that it was in two books and was
reckoned the most untrustworthy of all accounts of India (Strabo, II.
i. 9). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb535" href="#pb535" name="pb535">535</a>]</span></p>

<i>Ptolemy II.</i></span> <span class="marginnote"><i>Ptolemy

a caravan road from Koptos on the Nile to Berenik&ecirc; on the Red Sea
(Strabo, XVII. i. 45) and for centuries the Indian trade resorted
either to this port or to the neighbouring Myos Hormos. He also sent to
India (apparently to A&#347;oka) an envoy named Dionysius, who is said
by Pliny (VI. 17) to have written an account of things Indian of which
no certain fragments appear to remain. But we know from the fragments
of</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Agatharkhides.</i></span><b>Agatharkhides</b> (born c.

Min. I. 111ff), states that in his time the Indian trade with Potana
(Patala) was in the hands of the Sab&aelig;ans of Yemen. (M&uuml;ller,
I. 191.) In fact it was not until the voyages of Eudoxos (see below)
that any direct trade sprang up between India and Egypt. The mention of
Patala as the mart resorted to by the Arabs shows that we are still in
Pliny&rsquo;s first period (see below).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Baktrian Greeks.</i></span><b>The

the M&acirc;urya empire (c. 180 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) their
leader being D&ecirc;m&ecirc;trios son of Euthyd&ecirc;mos, whose
conquests are referred to by Justin (XLI. 6) and Strabo (XI. ii. 1).
But the most extensive conquests to the east and south were made by
Menandros (c. 110 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) who advanced to the
Jumna and conquered the whole coast from Pattal&ecirc;n&ecirc; (lower
Sindh) to the kingdoms of Saraostos (<span class="corr" id="xd25e45279"

Sigertis (Pliny&rsquo;s Sigerus?) (Strabo, XI. ii. 1). These statements
of Strabo are confirmed by the author of the Periplus (c. 250
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>) who says that in his time <i>drakhmai</i>
with Greek inscriptions of Menandros and Apollodotos were still current
at Barygaza (Per. 47). Apollodotos is now generally thought to have
been the successor of Menandros (<span class="sc">C.</span> 100
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>) (Brit. Museum Cat. of Bactrian Coins page
xxxiii.). Plutarch (<span lang="la">Reip. Ger. Princ.</span>) tells us
that Menandros&rsquo; rule was so mild, that on his death his towns
disputed the possession of his ashes and finally divided them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Eudoxos of Cyzicus.</i></span><b>Eudoxos

with others two very successful voyages to India, in the first of which
the company were guided by an Indian who had been shipwrecked on the
Egyptian coast. Strabo (II. iii. 4), in quoting the story of his doings
from Poseid&ocirc;nios, lays more stress upon his attempt to
circumnavigate Africa than upon these two Indian voyages, but they are
of very great importance as the beginnings of the direct trade with
India.</p>

mention as having first given wide currency to the notion that the
width of India from west to east was greater than its length from north
to south, an error which lies at the root of Ptolemy&rsquo;s distortion
of the map. Eratosthen&ecirc;s&rsquo; critic Hipparkhos (c. 130
<span class="sc">b.c.</span>) on this point followed the more correct
account of Megasthen&ecirc;s, and is otherwise notable as the first to
make use of astronomy for the determination of the geographical

<i>Strabo.</i></span> who brought presents consisting of an armless
man, snakes, a huge turtle and a large partridge, with a letter in
Greek written on parchment offering free passage and traffic through
his dominions to the emperor&rsquo;s subjects. With these envoys came a
certain Zarmanokh&ecirc;gas (&#346;rama&#7751;&acirc;c&acirc;rya,
Lassen) from Bargos&ecirc; (Broach, the earliest mention of the name)
who afterwards burnt himself at Athens, &ldquo;according to the
ancestral custom of the Indians.&rdquo; The fact that the embassy came
from Broach and passed through Antioch shows that they took the route
by the Persian Gulf, which long remained one of the chief lines of
trade (<abbr>Per.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 36). If the
embassy was not a purely commercial speculation on the part of
merchants of Broach, it is hard to see how king P&ocirc;ros, who had
600 under-kings, can be other than the Indo-Skythian Kozolakadaphes,
who held P&ocirc;ros&rsquo; old kingdom as well as much other territory
in North-West India. This if correct would show that as early as the
beginning of our era the Indo-Skythian power reached as far south as
Broach. The fact that the embassy took the Persian Gulf route and that
their object was to open commercial relations with the Roman empire
seems to show that at this period there was no direct trade between
Broach and the Egyptian ports of the Red Sea. Strabo however mentions
that in his time Arabian and Indian wares were carried on camels from
Myos Hormos (near R&acirc;s Abu Somer) on the Red Sea to Koptos on the
Nile (XVII. i. 45 and XVI. iv. 24) and dilates upon the increase of the
Indian trade since the days of the Ptolemies when not so many as twenty
ships dared pass through the Red Sea &ldquo;to peer out of the
Straits,&rdquo; whereas in his time whole fleets of as many as 120
vessels voyaged to India and the headlands of Ethiopia from Myos Hormos
(II. v. 12 and XV. i. 13). It would seem that we have here to do with
Pliny&rsquo;s second period of Indian trade, when Sigerus (probably
Janjira) was the goal of the Egyptian shipmasters (see below). Strabo
learnt these particulars during his stay in Egypt with Aelius Gallus,
but they were unknown to his contemporary Diod&ocirc;ros who drew his
account of India entirely from Megasthen&ecirc;s (Diod. II.
31&ndash;42) and had no knowledge of the East beyond the stories told
by Jamboulos a person of uncertain date of an island in the Indian
Archipelago (Bali, according to Lassen) (Diod. II. 57&ndash;60).
Pomponius Mela (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;43) also had no
recent information as regards India.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Pliny.</i></span><b>Pliny</b>
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;23&ndash;79) who published his
Natural History in <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;77 gives a fairly
full account of India, chiefly drawn from Megasthen&ecirc;s (see
above). He also gives two valuable pieces of contemporary
information:</p>
<p>(i) An account of Ceylon (Taproban&ecirc;) to which a freedman of
Annius Plocamus, farmer of the Red Sea tribute, was carried by stress
of weather in the reign of Claudius (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;41&ndash;54). On his return the king sent to the
emperor four envoys, headed by one Rachias (VI. 22).</p>
<p>(ii) An account of the voyage from Alexandria to India by a course
which had only lately been made known (VI. 23). Pliny divides the
history of navigation from the time of Nearchus to his own age into
three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) the period of sailing from Syagrus (R&acirc;s Fartak) in
Arabia to Patal&ecirc; (Indus delta) by the south-west wind called
Hippalus, 1332 miles;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) the period of sailing from Syagrus (R&acirc;s Fartak) to
Sigerus (<i>Ptol.</i> Miliz&ecirc;gyris, <i>Peripl.</i> Melizeigara,
probably Janj&iacute;ra, and perhaps the same as Strabo&rsquo;s
Sigertis);</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) the modern period, when traffic went on from Alexandria
to Koptos up the Nile, and thence by camels across the desert to
Berenice (in Foul Bay), 257 miles. Thence the merchants start in the
middle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb537" href="#pb537" name="pb537">537</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>

<i>Pliny.</i></span> summer before the rising of the dogstar and in
thirty days reach Okelis (Ghalla) or Cane (Hisn Ghorab), the former
port being most frequented by the Indian trade. From Okelis it is a
forty days&rsquo; voyage to Muziris (Muyyiri, Kranganur) which is
dangerous on account of the neighbouring pirates of Nitrias (Mangalor)
and inconvenient by reason of the distance of the roads from the shore.
Another better port is Becare (Kalla&#7693;a, Yule) belonging to the
tribe Neacyndon (<i>Ptol.</i> Melkynda, <i>Peripl.</i> Nelkynda) of the
kingdom of Pandion (P&acirc;&#7751;&#7693;ya) whose capital is Modura
(Madura). Here pepper is brought in canoes from Cottonara
(Ka&#7693;attan&acirc;&#7693;u). The ships return to the Red Sea in
December or January.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that the modern improvement in navigation on which Pliny
lays so much stress consisted, not in making use of the monsoon wind,
but in striking straight across the Indian ocean to the Malabar coast.
The fact that the ships which took this course carried a guard of
archers in Pliny&rsquo;s time, but not in that of the Periplus, is
another indication that the direct route to Malabar was new and
unfamiliar in the first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> The name
Hippalus given to the monsoon wind will be discussed below in dealing
with the Periplus.</p>

gives a very superficial description of India but has a valuable notice
of the Southern Skythians who live along the river Indus to the east of
the Gedr&ocirc;soi (I. 1087&ndash;88).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Klaudios
Ptolemaios.</i></span><b>Klaudios Ptolemaios</b> of Alexandria lived
according to Suidas under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;161&ndash;180). He compiled his account of India
as part of a geographical description of the then known world, and drew
much of his materials from Marinos of Tyre, whose work is lost, but who
must have written about <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;130. Ptolemy
(or Marinos before him) had a very wide knowledge of India, drawn
partly from the relations of shipmasters and traders and partly from
Indian lists similar to those of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd25e45467" title="Source: Pur&acirc;nas">Pur&acirc;&#7751;as</span></i> but drawn up in
Pr&acirc;k&#7771;it. He seems to have made little if any use of
Megasthen&ecirc;s and the companions of Alexander. But his map of India
is distorted by the erroneous idea, which he took from
Eratosthen&ecirc;s, that the width of India from west to east greatly
exceeded its length from north to south. Ptolemy begins his description
of India with the first chapter of his seventh book, which deals with
India within the Ganges. He gives first the names of rivers, countries,
towns, and capes along the whole coast of India from the westernmost
mouth of the Indus to the easternmost mouth of the Ganges. He next
mentions in detail the mountains and the rivers with their tributaries,
and then proceeds to enumerate the various nations of India and the
cities belonging to each, beginning with the north-west and working
southwards: and he finally gives a list of the islands lying off the
coast. In dealing with his account of western India it will be
convenient to notice together the cities of each nation which he
mentions separately under the heads of coast and inland towns.</p>
<p>He gives the name of Indo-Skythia to the whole country on both sides
of the lower course of the Indus from its junction with the Koa
(K√°bul river), and gives its three divisions as
Patal&ecirc;n&ecirc; (lower Sindh) Abiria (read Sabiria, that is
Sauv&icirc;ra or upper Sindh and <span class="corr" id="xd25e45472"

<i>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</i></span> He enumerates seven mouths of the
Indus, but the river is so constantly changing its course that it is
hopeless to expect to identify all the names given by him (Sagapa,
Sinth&ocirc;n, Khariphron, Sapara, Sabalaessa, and L&ocirc;nibare) with
the existing channels. Only it may be noted that Sinth&ocirc;n
preserves the Indian name of the river (Sindhu) and that the
easternmost mouth (L&ocirc;nibare) probably represents both the present
Kor&icirc; or Laun&icirc; and the L&ucirc;n&icirc; river of
M&acirc;rw&acirc;r, a fact which goes some way to explain why Ptolemy
had no idea of the existence of Kachh, though he knows the Ran as the
gulf of Kanthi. Hence he misplaces Surastr&ecirc;n&ecirc;
(Sur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra or K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a) in the
Indus delta instead of south of the Ran. Ptolemy enumerates a group of
five towns in the north-western part of Indo-Skythia (Kohat, Bannu, and
Dera Ismail Kh&acirc;n) of which Cunningham (<abbr title="Ancient Geography">Anc. Geog.</abbr> pages 84ff) has identified
Banagara with Bannu, and Andrapana with Daraban, while the sites of
Artoarta, Sabana, and Kodrana are unknown. Ptolemy next gives a list of
twelve towns along the western bank of the Indus to the sea. Of these
Embolima has been identified by Cunningham (<abbr title="Ancient Geography">Anc. Geog.</abbr> page 52) with Amb sixty miles
above Attok, and Pasip&ecirc;da is identified by St. Martin with the
Besmaid of the Arab geographers and placed near Mithankot at the
junction of the Chenab with the Indus. Sousikana, which comes next in
the list to Pasip&ecirc;&#7693;a, is generally thought to be a
corruption of Mousikanos, and is placed by the latest authority
(General Haig, <i>The Indus Delta Country</i>, page 130) in
<span class="corr" id="xd25e45502" title="Source: Bahawalpur">Bah&acirc;walpur</span>, though Cunningham
(<abbr title="Ancient Geography">Anc. Geog.</abbr> page 257) puts it at
Alor, which is somewhat more in accordance with Ptolemy&rsquo;s
distances. K&ocirc;laka the most southerly town of the list, cannot
well be the Kr&ocirc;kala of Arrian (Kar&acirc;chi) as McCrindle
supposes, for Ptolemy puts it nearly a degree north of the western
mouth of the Indus.</p>
<p>The two great towns of the delta which Ptolemy next mentions, are
placed by General Haig, Patala at a point thirty-five miles south-east
of Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d (<i>op. cit.</i> page 19) and Barbarei near
Sh&acirc;h Bandar (<i>op. cit.</i> page 31). Barbarei is mentioned
again in the Periplus (chapter 38) under the name of Barbarikon.
Ptolemy gives the names of nine towns on the left bank of the Indus
from the confluence to the sea, but very few of them can be
satisfactorily identified. Panasa can only be Osanpur (St. Martin) on
Fluellen&rsquo;s principles. Boudaia must represent the Budh&icirc;ya
of the Arabs, though it is on the wrong side of the river (see Haig,
<i>op. cit.</i> page 57ff). Naagramma may with Yule be placed at
Naushahro. Kamigara cannot be Aror (McCrindle), if that place
represents Sousikana. Binagara is commonly thought to be a corrupt
reading of Minnagara (compare Periplus chapter 38). Haig (<i>op.
cit.</i> page 32 note 47) refers to the Tuhfatu&rsquo;l Kir&acirc;m as
mentioning a Minnagar in pargana Sh&acirc;hd&acirc;dpur (north-east of
Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d). Parabali, Sydros, and Epitausa have not been
identified, but must be looked for either in Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d or
in Thar and P&acirc;rkar. Xoana may with Yule be identified with Siwana
in the bend of the L&ucirc;n&icirc; and gives another indication that
Ptolemy confounded the L&ucirc;n&icirc; with the eastern mouth of the
Indus.</p>
<p>On the coast of Surastr&ecirc;n&ecirc;
(K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a) Ptolemy mentions, first, the
island of Barak&ecirc; (Dv&acirc;rak&acirc; B&ecirc;t): then the city
Bardax&ecirc;ma which must be Porbandar (Yule), in front of the Barada
hills: then the village of Surastra, which perhaps represents
Ver&acirc;val, though it is placed too far north. Surastra cannot well
be Jun&acirc;gad (Lassen) which is not on the coast and in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s time was not a village, but a city, though it is
certainly strange that Ptolemy does not anywhere mention it. Further
south Ptolemy places the mart of Monogl&ocirc;sson (Mangrol). The
eastern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name="pb539">539</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix VI.<br>
<span class="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</span><br>
<i>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</i></span> boundary of the coast of
Indo-Skythia seems to have been the mouth of the M&ocirc;phis
(Mah&icirc;). Ptolemy&rsquo;s account of Indo-Skythia may be completed
by mentioning the list of places, which he puts to the east of the
Indus (<i>i. e.</i> the L&ucirc;n&icirc;) and at some distance from
it.</p>
<p>These are: Xodrak&ecirc;, which has not been identified, but which
must be placed somewhere in Mew&acirc;r, perhaps at the old city of
P&ucirc;r, seventy-two miles north-east of Udaipur, or possibly at the
old city of Ahar, two miles from Udaipur itself (Tod&rsquo;s
R&acirc;jasth&acirc;n, I. 677&ndash;78).</p>
<p>Sarbana, which is marked in Ptolemy&rsquo;s map at the head-waters
of the Mah&icirc; in the Apokopa mountains (Aravallis), must be
identified with Sarwan about ten miles north-west of Ratl&acirc;m.
There is also a place called Sarwanio close to Nimach, which Ptolemy
may have confused with Sarwan.</p>
<p>Auxoamis, which St. Martin identifies with S&ucirc;m&icirc;, and
Yule with Ajmir, but neither place suits the distance and direction
from Sarwan. If Ptolemy, as above suggested, confused Sarwan and
Sarwanio, Auxoamis may be Ahar near Udaipur, P&ucirc;r being then
Xodrak&ecirc;: otherwise Auxoamis may be &Iacute;dar. The question can
only be settled by more exact knowledge of the age of Ahar and of
&Iacute;dar. Orbadarou may provisionally with Yule be placed at
&Acirc;bu.</p>
<p>Asinda must be looked for near Sidhpur, though it cannot with St.
Martin be identified with that place. Perhaps Vadnagar (formerly
&Acirc;nandapura and a very old town) may be its modern
representative.</p>
<p>Theophila may be Devaliya (Yule) or Th&acirc;n (Burgess) in
north-east K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a.</p>
<p>Astakapra is admitted to be Hastakavapra or H&acirc;thab near
Bh&acirc;vnagar (B&uuml;hler).</p>
<p><i>Larik&ecirc;</i> is described by Ptolemy next after Indo-Skythia
on his way down the West Coast. The northern limit of its coast was the
mouth of the river M&ocirc;phis (Mah&icirc;). Its name is the
L&acirc;&#7789;a of <i>pur&acirc;&#7751;as</i> and inscriptions.
Ptolemy mentions as on its coast the village of Pakidar&ecirc;, which
may be a misreading for K&acirc;pidar&ecirc; and represent
K&acirc;v&icirc; (K&acirc;pik&acirc; of inscriptions) a holy place just
south of the Mah&icirc;. Next comes Cape Male&ocirc;, which Ptolemy
both in his text and in his map includes in Larik&ecirc;, though there
is no prominent headland in a suitable position on the east side of the
Gulf of Cambay. As he puts it 2&frac14; degrees west of Broach, it may
probably be identified with <span class="corr" id="xd25e45561" title="Source: G&ocirc;pn&acirc;th">Gopn&acirc;th</span> Point in
K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a on the other side of the gulf (the
P&acirc;pik&ecirc; of the Periplus), his name for it surviving in the
neighbouring shoals known as the Malai banks. It is in agreement with
this that Ptolemy puts the mouth of the river Namados (Narmad&acirc;)
to the north of Cape Male&ocirc;. South of the river is Kaman&ecirc;
which may be identified with the Kamanijja or Karma&#7751;&ecirc;ya of
inscriptions, that is with Kamlej on the Tapt&icirc; above Surat. It
has been supposed to be the Kamm&ocirc;ni of the Periplus (chapter 43),
which was the village opposite to the reef called
H&ecirc;r&ocirc;n&ecirc; on the right (east) of the gulf of Barygaza:
but it is perhaps best to separate the two and to identify
Kamm&ocirc;ni with Kim, north of Olp&acirc;d. The next town mentioned
is Nousaripa, which should probably be read Nousarika, being the
Navas&acirc;rik&acirc; of inscriptions and the modern
Naus&acirc;r&icirc;. The most southerly town of Larik&ecirc; is
Poulipoula, which has been identified with Phulp&acirc;d&acirc; or old
Surat, but is too far south. Bilimora is perhaps the most likely
position for it, though the names do not correspond (unless Pouli is
the Dravidian <i>Puli</i> or <i>poli</i> = a tiger, afterwards replaced
by <i>Bili</i> = a cat). Ptolemy begins his list of the inland cities
of Larik&ecirc; with Agrinagara, which may with Yule be identified with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540" name="pb540">540</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix VI.<br>
<span class="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</span><br>
<i>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</i></span> &Acirc;gar, thirty-five miles
north-east of Ujjain, and the &Acirc;kara of inscriptions. The next
town is Siripalla, which has not been identified, but should be looked
for about thirty miles to the south-east of Agar, not far from
Sh&acirc;hjah&acirc;npur. The modern name would probably be Shirol.
Bammogoura must be identified, not with Pawangad (Yule), but with Hiuen
Tsiang&rsquo;s &ldquo;city of the Br&acirc;hmans&rdquo; (Beal,
Si-yu-ki, II. 262), 200 <i>li</i> (about 33 miles) to the north-west of
the capital of M&acirc;lava in his time. The distance and direction
bring us nearly to Jaora. Sazantion and Zerogerei have not been
satisfactorily identified but may provisionally be placed at
Ratl&acirc;m and Badnawar respectively, or Z&ecirc;rogerei may be
Dh&acirc;r as Yule suggested. Oz&ecirc;n&ecirc; the capital of
Tiastan&ecirc;s is Ujjain the capital of the Kshatrapa Cash&#7789;ana
who reigned c. 130 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> His kingdom included
Western M&acirc;lw&acirc;, West <span class="corr" id="xd25e45594"
title="Source: Khandesh">Kh√°ndesh</span>, and the whole of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e45597" title="Source: Guj√°rat">Gujar√°t</span> south of the Mah&icirc;.
His grandson Rudrad&acirc;man (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150)
tells us in his Girn&acirc;r inscription (I. A. VII. 259) that his own
kingdom included also M&acirc;rw&acirc;r Sindh and the lower
Panj&acirc;b. Next to Ujjain Ptolemy mentions Minnagara, which must
have been somewhere near M&acirc;npur. Then we come to Tiatoura or
Ch&acirc;ndor (Yule) on the ridge which separates <span class="corr"
id="xd25e45604" title="Source: Khandesh">Kh√°ndesh</span> from
the valley of the God&acirc;vari, and finally on that river itself
Nasika the modern N&acirc;sik. It is very doubtful whether N&acirc;sik
at any time formed part of the dominions of Cash&#7789;ana, since we
know from the inscriptions in the N&acirc;sik caves that the Kshatrapas
were driven out of that part of the country by Gautam&icirc;putra
&#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;i, the father of Ptolemy&rsquo;s contemporary
Pulum&acirc;yi. Ptolemy probably found N&acirc;sik mentioned in one of
his lists as on a road leading from Ujjain southwards and he concluded
that they belonged to the same kingdom.</p>
<p><i>Ariak&ecirc;</i> of the Sadinoi included the coast of the Konkan
as far south as Baltipatna (near Mah&acirc;d) and the Deccan between
the God&acirc;vari and the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. The name occurs in
Var&acirc;ha Mihira&rsquo;s B&#7771;ihat Sam&#775;hit&acirc; XIV. in
the form &Acirc;ryaka. The tribal name Sadinoi is less easy to explain.
The suggested connection with the word <i>S&acirc;dhana</i> as meaning
an agent (Lassen) and its application to the Kshatrapas of <span class="corr" id="xd25e45614" title="Source: Gujarat">Gujar√°t</span>,
are not tenable. The only authority for this meaning of
<i>S&acirc;dhana</i> is Wilson&rsquo;s Sanskrit Dictionary, and at this
time it is certain that Ariak&ecirc; belonged, not to the Kshatrapas of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e45620" title="Source: Gujarat">Gujar√°t</span>, but to the
&#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;is of Paithan on the God&acirc;vari.
Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar&rsquo;s identification of the Sadinoi with
Var&acirc;ha Mihira&rsquo;s &#346;&acirc;ntikas seems also somewhat
unsatisfactory. Ptolemy&rsquo;s name may possibly be a corruption of
&#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;i or &#346;&acirc;tav&acirc;hana. The coast
towns of this region were Soupara (Sup&acirc;r&acirc; near Bassein),
south of which Ptolemy places the river Goaris (Vaitara&#7751;&icirc;),
Dounga (perhaps Dug√°&#7693; ten miles north of Bhiwndi) south of
which is the B&ecirc;nda river (Bhiwnd&icirc; Creek), Simylla, a mart
and a cape, the Automula and Perimula of Pliny and the modern Cheul
(Chemula); Miliz&ecirc;gyris an island, the same as the
Meliz&ecirc;igara of the Periplus and (probably) as the Sigerus of
Pliny and the modern Janj&icirc;ra; Hippokoura, either Ghodeg&acirc;on
or Ku&#7693;&acirc; (Yule) in Kol&acirc;b&acirc; district; Baltipatna,
probably the Palaipatmai of the Periplus and the same as P&acirc;l near
Mah&acirc;d.</p>
<p>The inland dominions of the Sadinoi were much more extensive than
their coast line. Ptolemy gives two lists of cities, one of those lying
to the west (<i>i. e.</i> north) of the B&ecirc;nda, whose course in
the Deccan represents the Bh&icirc;m&acirc; river, and the other of
those between the B&ecirc;nda and the Pseudostomos (here the
M&acirc;lprabh&acirc; and K&#7771;ish&#7751;a or possibly the
Tungabhadra with its tributaries). The most easterly towns in the first
list, Malippala and Sarisabis, are not satisfactorily identified, but
must be looked for in the Niz&acirc;m&rsquo;s country to the south-east
of <span class="corr" id="xd25e45628" title="Source: Haid&acirc;r&acirc;b&acirc;d">Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d</span><span class="corr"
id="xd25e45630" title="Source: ,">.</span> Next comes Tagara mentioned
in the Periplus (chapter 51) as ten days east from Paithan, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb541" href="#pb541" name="pb541">541</a>]</span> <span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix VI.<br>
<span class="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</span><br>
<i>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</i></span> therefore about the latitude of
Kulbarga, with which it is identified by Yule. The distance and
direction make its identification with Deogir (Wilford and others),
Junnar (Bhagwanl&acirc;l), or Kolh&acirc;pur (Fleet) impossible. The
best suggestion hitherto made is that it is D&acirc;rur or Dh&acirc;rur
(Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar), but D&acirc;rur in the Bh&icirc;r district is
too far north, so Dh&acirc;rur fifty miles west of
Haidar&acirc;b&acirc;d must be taken as the most likely site. Next to
Tagara Ptolemy mentions Baithana, which is the Paithana of the Periplus
and the modern Paithan on the God&acirc;vari. It is called by our
author the capital of Siroptolemaios, who is the
&#346;r&icirc;-Pulum&acirc;yi of the N&acirc;sik cave inscriptions.
Next to Baithana comes Deopali, which may safely be identified with the
modern Deoli in the suburbs of Ahmadnagar. Gamaliba, the next stage,
must be placed somewhere on the line between Ahmednagar and Junnar,
which latter ancient town is to be identified with Ptolemy&rsquo;s
Om&ecirc;nogara, although this name is not easy to explain.</p>
<p>The second list of towns in Ariak&ecirc; begins with Nagarouris
(Nagarapur&icirc;) which probably represents Poona which even then must
have been a place of importance, being at the head of the great road
down the Bhorghat. Tabas&ocirc; (compare Var&acirc;ha Mihira&rsquo;s
T&acirc;pas&acirc;&#347;r&acirc;m&acirc;h&#803; and Ptolemy&rsquo;s own
Tabasoi) may be the holy city of Pandharpur. Ind&ecirc; has retained
its ancient name (Ind&icirc; in the north of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e45649" title="Source: Bijapur">B&icirc;j&acirc;pur</span>
district). Next follows Tiripangalida (T&icirc;kota in the
Kurundw&acirc;d State&nbsp;?) and then Hippokoura, the capital of
Baleokuros. Dr. Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar has identified this king with
the Viliv&acirc;yak&ucirc;ra of coins found in the Kolh√°pur
state. His capital may possibly be Hippargi in the Sindgi taluka of the
B&icirc;j&acirc;pur district. Soubouttou, the next town on
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list, is not identifiable, but the name which follows,
Sirimalaga, must be Sirn&acirc;l in the B&icirc;j&acirc;pur taluka of
the same district.</p>
<p>Kalligeris may be identified not with Ka&#7751;hagiri (McCrindle)
but with Galgali at the crossing of the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and
Modogoulla is not M&ucirc;dgal (McCrindle) but Mudhol on the
Gh&acirc;tprabh&acirc;. Petirgala should probably read Penengala, and
would then represent the old town of Panangala or Hongal in the
Dh&acirc;rv&acirc;&#7693; district. The last name on the list is
Banaouasei, which is Vanav&acirc;s&icirc;, about ten miles from Sirsi
in Kanara, a very old town where a separate branch of the
&#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;is once ruled.</p>
<p><i>The Pirate Coast</i> is the next division of Western India
described by Ptolemy, who mentions five sea-ports but only two inland
cities. It is clear that the pirates were hemmed in on the land side by
the dominions of the &#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;is, and that they held
but little territory above the gh&acirc;ts, though their capital
Mousopall&ecirc; was in that region. The places on the coast from north
to south were Mandagara, the Mandagara of the Periplus (chapter 53)
which has been satisfactorily identified with Mandanga&#7693; to the
south of the B&acirc;nkot creek.</p>
<p>Byzantion, which, as Dr. Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar first pointed out,
is the Vaijayant&icirc; of inscriptions may be placed either at Chiplun
or at <span class="corr" id="xd25e45661" title="Source: Dabhol">D√°bhol</span> at the mouth of the
V&acirc;sish&#7789;h&icirc; river. Chiplun is the only town of great
antiquity in this part of the Kon&#775;ka&#7751;, and if it is not
Vaijayant&icirc; Ptolemy has passed over it altogether. The similarity
of the names has suggested the identification of Byzantion with
Jayga&#7693; (Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar) or Vijayadrug (Vincent), but both
these places are comparatively modern. There are indeed no very ancient
towns in the Kon&#775;ka&#7751; between San&#775;gam&ecirc;shvar and
the S&acirc;vantv&acirc;&#7693;i border.</p>
<p>Kherson&ecirc;sos is generally admitted to be the peninsula of Goa.

<i>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</i></span> Armagara is placed a little to the
north of the river Nanagouna and may be represented by Cape Ramas in
Portuguese territory.</p>
<p>The river Nanagouna here is generally supposed to be the
K&acirc;l&icirc;nad&icirc;, though in its upper course it seems to
represent the Tapt&icirc;, and a confusion with the N&acirc;n&acirc;
pass led Ptolemy to bring it into connection with the rivers Goaris and
B&ecirc;nda (Campbell).</p>
<p>Nitra, the southernmost mart on the pirate coast, is the Nitrias of
Pliny, and has been satisfactorily identified by Yule with Mangalor on
the N&ecirc;travat&icirc;.</p>
<p>The inland cities of the Pirates are Olokhoira and Mousopall&ecirc;
the capital, both of which must be sought for in the rugged country
about the sources of the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and may provisionally be
identified with the ancient towns of Kar&acirc;&#7693; and Karv&icirc;r
(Kolh√°pur) respectively. To complete Ptolemy&rsquo;s account of
this coast it is only necessary to mention the islands of
Heptan&ecirc;sia (Burnt Islands&nbsp;?) Trikadiba and Peperin&ecirc;.
We are not here concerned with his account of the rest of India.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Bardesan&ecirc;s.</i></span><b><span class="corr" id="xd25e45692" title="Source: Bardesan&eacute;s">Bardesan&ecirc;s</span></b> met at Babylon
certain envoys sent from India to the emperor Antoninus Pius
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;154&ndash;181) and received from

customs of the Br&acirc;hmans and of a rock temple containing a statue
of &#346;iva in the Ardhan&acirc;r&icirc; form. Lassen (III. 62 and

Western India, but neither of these conclusions is necessary. The

<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Periplus.</i></span><b>The Periplus of
the Erythrean Sea</b>, formerly though wrongly attributed to Arrian
(150&nbsp;<span class="sc">a.d.</span>), is an account of the Egyptian
trade with East Africa and India, written by a merchant of Alexandria
for the use of his fellows. It is preserved in a single manuscript
which in some places is very corrupt. The age of this work has been
much disputed: the chief views as to this matter are,</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) that the Periplus was written before Pliny and made use of by
him (Vincent, Schwanbeck, and Glaser). The arguments of Vincent and
Schwanbeck are refuted by M&uuml;ller (Geogr. Gr. Min. I. xcviii.)
Glaser&rsquo;s case is (<span lang="de">Ausland</span> 1891, page 45)
that the Malikhas of the Periplus is Malchos III. of Nabath&aelig;a
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;49&ndash;71), that the Periplus
knows Mero&ecirc; as capital of Ethiopia, while at the time of
Nero&rsquo;s expedition to East Africa (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;68), it had almost vanished, and lastly that the
author of the Periplus is Basilis or Basil&ecirc;s, whom Pliny names as
an authority for his Book VI. It may be replied that Malikhas is the
title Malik and may have been applied to any Arab Sheikh (Reinaud):
that the Periplus does not with certainty mention Mero&ecirc; at all:
and that Basilis whether or not a contemporary of Ptolemy Philadelphos
was at any rate earlier than Agatharkhid&ecirc;s (c. 200 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), who quotes him (<abbr>Geog. Gr. Min.</abbr> I.
156);</li>
<li>(ii) that the Periplus was written at the same time as
Pliny&rsquo;s work, but neither used the other (Salmasius). This view
is refuted by M&uuml;ller (<i>op. cit.</i> page 155);</li>
<li>(iii) that the Periplus was written after 161 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> (Dodwell); M&uuml;ller has shown
(<i>ibid</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e45738" title="Not in source">.</span>) that Dodwell&rsquo;s arguments are

<i>Periplus.</i></span> The only choice lies between the view of
M&uuml;ller and that of Reinaud. M&uuml;ller argues for a date between
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;80 and <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;89, because the Periplus knows no more than Pliny
of India beyond the Ganges, whereas Ptolemy&rsquo;s knowledge is much
greater: because the Periplus calls Ceylon Palaisimoundou, which is to
Ptolemy (VII. iv. 1) an old name: because the Nabath&aelig;an kingdom,
which was destroyed <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;105, was still in
existence at the time of the Periplus: because the Periplus account of
Hippalos shows it to be later than Pliny: and because the Periplus
mentions king Z&ocirc;skal&ecirc;s, who must be the Za Hakal&ecirc; of
the Abyssinian lists who reigned <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;77&ndash;89. It may be replied that the Periplus
is not a geography of Eastern Asia, but a guide book for traders with
certain ports only: that Ptolemy must have found in his lists three
names for Ceylon, Taproban&ecirc;, Palaisimoundou, and Salik&ecirc;,
and that he has wrongly separated Palai from Simoundou, taking it to
mean &ldquo;formerly&rdquo; and therefore entered Simoundou as the old
and Salik&ecirc; as the modern name,<a class="noteref" id="n543.asrc"
href="#n543.a" name="n543.asrc">2</a> whereas all three names were in
use together: that the Nabath&aelig;an king Malikhas was simply the
Sheikh of the tribe (Reinaud), and points to no definite date: that the
Periplus&rsquo; account of Hippalos is certainly later than Pliny: and
that the Z&ocirc;skal&ecirc;s of the Periplus is the Za S&acirc;gal or
Za Asgal of the Abyssinian lists, who reigned <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;246&ndash;47 (Reinaud).</p>
<p>It follows that Reinaud&rsquo;s date for the Periplus (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250) is the only one consistent with the facts
and especially with the Indian facts. As will appear below, the growth
of the Hippalos legend since Pliny&rsquo;s time, the rival Parthians in
Sindh, the mention of Mambaros and the supplanting of Oz&ecirc;n&ecirc;
by Minnagara as his capital since Ptolemy&rsquo;s time, the
independence of Baktria, and the notices of Saragan&ecirc;s and
Sandan&ecirc;s, are all points strongly in favour of Reinaud&rsquo;s
date.</p>
<p>In the time of the Periplus the ships carrying on the Indian trade
started from Myos Hormos (near Ras Abu Somer) or Berenik&ecirc; (in
Foul Bay) and sailed down the Red Sea to Mouza (Musa twenty-five miles
north of Mokh&acirc;), and thence to the watering place Ok&ecirc;lis
(Ghalla) at the Straits. They then followed the Arabian coast as far as
Kan&ecirc; (Hisn Ghur&acirc;b in Hadramaut) passing on the way

lang="grc">&Kappa;&Alpha;&Iota;&Sigma;&Alpha;&Rho;</span></span></span>
of the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>) From Kan&ecirc; the routes
to India diverge, some ships sailing to the Indus and on to Barygaza,
and others direct to the ports of Limyrik&ecirc; (Malab√°r
Coast). There was also another route to Limyrik&ecirc;, starting from
Ar&ocirc;mata (Cape Guardafui). In all three voyages the ships made use
of the monsoon, starting from Egypt in July. The monsoon was called
Hippalos, according to the Periplus (chapter 57), after the navigator
who first discovered the direct course across the sea, and it has been
inferred from Pliny&rsquo;s words (VI. 23) that this pilot lived in the
middle of the first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> But
Pliny&rsquo;s own account shows that, as we should expect, the progress
from a coasting to a direct voyage was a gradual one, with several
intermediate stages, in all of which the monsoon was more or less made
use of. There was therefore no reason for naming the wind from the
pilot who merely made the last step. Further though Pliny knows
Hippalus as the local name of the monsoon wind in the eastern seas, he
says nothing of its having been the name of the inventor of the direct
course. The inference seems to be that Hippalos the pilot is the child
of a seaman&rsquo;s yarn arising out of the local name of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name="pb544">544</a>]</span>

Periplus and not in Pliny shows that the former writer is much later
than the latter.</p>
<p>The merchant bound for Skythia (Sindh) before he reaches land, which
lies low to the northward, meets the white water from the river Sinthos
(Indus) and water snakes (chapter 38). The river has seven mouths,
small and marshy all but the middle one, on which is the port of
Barbarikon (Sh&acirc;hbandar, Haig, page 31) whence the
merchants&rsquo; wares are carried up by river to the capital Minnagar
(near Sh&acirc;hd&acirc;dpur, Haig, page 32), which is ruled by
Parthians who constantly expel one another (chapter 39). These
contending Parthians must have been the remnant of the Kar&ecirc;n
Pahlavs who joined with the Kush&acirc;ns to attack Ardeshir
P&acirc;pak&acirc;n (<abbr title="Journal Asiatique">Journ. As.</abbr>
[1866] VII. 134). The imports are clothing, flowered cottons, topazes,
coral, storax, frankincense, glass vessels, silver plate, specie, and
wine: and the exports costus (spice), bdellium (gum), yellow dye,
spikenard, emeralds, sapphires, furs from Tibet, cottons, silk thread,
and indigo. The list of imports shows that the people of Skythia were a
civilised race and by no means wild nomads.</p>
<p>The Periplus next (chapter 40) gives an accurate account of the Ran
(Eirinon) which in those days was probably below sea level (Haig, page
22, Burnes&rsquo; Travels into Bokhara, III. 309ff), and was already
divided into the Great and the Little. Both were marshy shallows even
out of sight of land and therefore dangerous to navigators. The Ran was
then as now bounded to south and west by seven islands, and the
headland Barak&ecirc; (Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;) a place of special danger
of whose neighbourhood ships were warned by meeting with great black
water-snakes.</p>
<p>The next chapter (41) describes the gulf of Barygaza (gulf of
Cambay) and the adjoining land, but the passage has been much mangled
by the copyist of our only <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> and more
still by the guesses of editors. According to the simplest correction
(<span class="trans" title="h&#275;rost&#275;s&rsquo; Ariak&#275;sch&#333;ra"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&#7973;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;&rsquo;
&Alpha;&rho;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&eta;&sigma;&chi;&omega;&rho;&alpha;</span></span>)
our author says that next after Barak&ecirc; (Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;)
follows the gulf of Barygaza and the country towards Ariak&ecirc;,
being the beginning of the kingdom of Mambaros and of all India.
Mambaros may possibly be a corruption of Makhatrapos or some similar
Greek form of Mah&acirc;kshatrapa, the title of the so-called
&ldquo;S&acirc;h Kings&rdquo; who ruled here at this period
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;250). According to the reading of
the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> the author goes on to say that
&ldquo;the inland part of this country bordering on the Ib&ecirc;ria
(read Sabiria = Sauv&icirc;ra) district of Skythia is called &hellip;
(the name, perhaps Maru, has dropped out of the text), and the
sea-coast Syrastr&ecirc;n&ecirc; (Sur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra).&rdquo; The
country abounded then as now in cattle, corn, rice, cotton and coarse
cotton cloth, and the people were tall and dark. The capital of the
country was Minnagara whence much cotton was brought down to Barygaza.
This Minnagara is perhaps the city of that name placed by Ptolemy near
M&acirc;npur in the Vindhyas, but it has with more probability been
identified with Jun&acirc;gad (Bhagv&acirc;nl&acirc;l) which was once
called Manipura (Kath. Gaz. 487). Our author states that in this part
of the country were to be found old temples, ruined camps and large
wells, relics (he says) of Alexander&rsquo;s march, but more probably
the work of Menandros and Apollodotos. This statement certainly points
to <span class="corr" id="xd25e45852" title="Source: K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;da">K&acirc;thi&acirc;v&acirc;&#7693;a</span>
rather than to M&acirc;npur. The voyage along this coast from
Barbarikon to the headland of P&acirc;pik&ecirc; (Gopn&acirc;th) near
Astakapra (H&acirc;thab) and opposite to Barygaza (Broach) was one of
3000 stadia = 300 miles, which is roughly correct. The next chapter
(42) describes the northern part of the gulf of Cambay as 300 stadia
wide and running northward to the river Ma&iuml;s (Mah&icirc;). Ships
bound for Barygaza steer first northward past the island <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href="#pb545" name="pb545">545</a>]</span>
<span class="fwMargin"><br>
Appendix VI.<br>
<span class="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</span><br>
<i>Periplus.</i></span> Bai&ocirc;nes (Peram) and then eastward towards
the mouth of the Namnadios (Narmad&acirc;) the river of Broach. The
navigation (chapter 43) is difficult by reason of rocks and shoals such
as H&ecirc;r&ocirc;n&ecirc; (perhaps named from some wreck) opposite
the village of Kamm&ocirc;ni (Kim) on the eastern shore and by reason
of the current on the western near <span class="corr" id="xd25e45870"
title="Source: P&acirc;pik&eacute;">P&acirc;pik&ecirc;</span> (perhaps
a sailor&rsquo;s name meaning Unlucky). Hence the government sends out
fishermen in long boats called Trappaga or Kotumba (Kotia) to meet the
ships (chapter 44) and pilot them into Barygaza, 300 stadia up the
river, by towing and taking advantage of the tides. In this connection
our author gives a graphic description of the Bore in the Narbad&acirc;
(chapter 45) and of the dangers to which strange ships are exposed
thereby (chapter 46).</p>
<p>Inland from Barygaza (that is, from the whole kingdom, which, as we
have seen, bordered on Sauv&icirc;ra or Mult&acirc;n) lay (chapter 47)
the Aratrioi (Ara&#7789;&#7789;as of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and
Pur&acirc;&#7751;as, who lived in the Panj&acirc;b), the
Arakh&ocirc;sioi (people of eastern Afghanistan), Gandaraioi
(Gandh&acirc;ra of N.-W. Panj&acirc;b), Proklais (near Pesh&acirc;war),
and beyond them the Baktrianoi (of Balkh) a most warlike race, governed
by their own independent sovereigns. These last are probably the
Kush&acirc;ns who, when the Parthian empire fell to pieces in the
second quarter of the third century, joined the Kar&ecirc;n Pahlavs in
attacking Ardeshir. It was from these parts, says our author, that
Alexander marched into India as far as the Ganges&mdash;an interesting
glimpse of the growth of the Alexander legend since the days of Arrian
(<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;150). Our author found old
<i>drakhmai</i> of Menandros and Apollodotos still current in
Barygaza.</p>
<p>Eastward in the same kingdom (chapter 48) is the city of
Oz&ecirc;n&ecirc;; which was formerly the capital, whence onyxes,
porcelain, muslins, and cottons are brought to Barygaza. From the
country beyond Proklais came costus, bdellium, and spikenard of three
kinds, the Kattybourine, the Patropapigic, and the Kabalitic (this last
from K√°bul).</p>
<p>We learn incidentally that besides the regular Egyptian trade
Barygaza had commercial relations with Mouza in Arabia (chapter 21)
with the East African coast (chapter 14) and with Apologos (Obollah) at
the head of the Persian Gulf and with Omana on its eastern shore
(chapter 36). The imports of Barygaza were wine, bronze, tin and lead,
coral and gold stone (topaz&nbsp;?), cloth of all sorts, variegated
sashes (like the horrible Berlin wool comforters of modern days),
storax, sweet clover, white glass, gum sandarac, stibium for the eyes,
and gold and silver coin, and unguents. Besides, there were imported
for the king costly silver plate, musical instruments (musical boxes
are still favoured by Indian royalty), handsome girls for the harem
(these are the famous Yavan&icirc; handmaids of the Indian drama),
high-class wine, apparel and choice unguents, a list which shows that
these monarchs lived in considerable luxury. The exports of Barygaza
were spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, onyxes, porcelain, box-thorn,
cottons, silk, silk thread, long pepper (chillies), and other wares
from the coast ports.</p>
<p>From Barygaza our author rightly says (chapter 50) that the coast
trends southward and the country is called Dakhinabad&ecirc;s
(Dakshi&#7751;&acirc;patha): much of the inland country is waste and
infested by wild beasts, while populous tribes inhabit other regions as
far as the Ganges. The chief towns in Dakhinabad&ecirc;s (chapter 51)
are Paithana (Paithan) twenty days journey south of Barygaza and Tagara
(Dh&acirc;rur) a very large city ten days east of Paithana. From
Paithana come onyxes, and from Tagara cottons muslins and other local
wares from the (east) coast. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb546" href="#pb546" name="pb546">546</a>]</span></p>

<i>Periplus.</i></span> The smaller ports south of Barygaza are
Akabarou (perhaps the Khabirun of Mahomedan writers and the modern
K&acirc;v&ecirc;r&icirc; the river of N&acirc;us&acirc;ri) Souppara
(Sup&acirc;r&acirc; near Bassein) and Kalliena, which was made a mart
by the elder Saragan&ecirc;s, but much injured when Sandan&ecirc;s
became its master, for from his time Greek vessels visiting the port
are sent under guard to Barygaza. This interesting statement is one of
the clearest indications of the date of the Periplus. As
Bh&acirc;nd&acirc;rkar has shown, the elder Saragan&ecirc;s implies
also a younger, who can be no other than Yaj&ntilde;a&#347;r&icirc;
&#346;&acirc;takar&#7751;i (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;140), and
the Periplus must be later than his time. The Sandan&ecirc;s of the
text must have been a ruler of <span class="corr" id="xd25e45905"
title="Source: Gujar&acirc;t">Gujar√°t</span> and may be
identified with the Kshatrapa San&#775;ghad&acirc;man (<span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;224).</p>
<p>South of Kalliena (chapter 53) were S&ecirc;mylla (Chaul) Mandagora
(Mandanga&#7693;) Palaipatmai (P&acirc;l near Mah&acirc;d) Melizeigara
(probably Janj&icirc;ra) and Byzantion (Chiplun). The words which
follow probably give another name of Byzantion &ldquo;which was
formerly also called Turannosboas,&rdquo; the name Toparon being a
misunderstanding (M&uuml;ller, Geogr. Gr. Min. I. 296). South of this
are the islands of S&ecirc;sekreienai (Burnt Islands), Aigidio&iacute;
(Angediva), Kaineitai (Island of St. George) near the Kherson&ecirc;sos
(Goa), and Leuk&ecirc; (Laccadives&nbsp;?) all pirate haunts. Next
comes Limyrik&ecirc; (the Tamil country) the first marts of which are
Naoura (Cannanor or Tellichery, rather than Hon√°var, which is
too far north) and Tyndis (Ka&#7693;alu&#7751;&#7693;i near Bepur) and
south of these Muziris (Kranganur) and Nelkynda (Kalla&#7693;a). Tyndis
and Muziris were subject to K&ecirc;probotras (Keralaputra that is the
Cera king) and Nelkynda to Pandion (the P&acirc;&#7751;&#7693;ya king
of Madura). Muziris was a very prosperous mart trading with
Ariak&ecirc; (North Konkan) as well as Egypt. Nelkynda was up a river
120 stadia from the sea, ships taking in cargo at the village of
Bekar&ecirc; at the mouth of the river. Our author gives an interesting
account of the trade at these ports and further south as well as on the
east coast, but we are not concerned with this part of his work.</p>

from an obscure geographer named Pr&ocirc;tagoras. He adds no new facts
to Ptolemy&rsquo;s account of western India.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Stephanos.</i></span><b>Stephanos</b> of

are chiefly taken from Hekataios, Arrianos, and especially from a poem
called Bassarika on the exploits of Dionysos, by a certain Dionysos.
But his geography is far from accurate: he calls Barak&ecirc;
(Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;) an island, and Barygaza (Broach) a city, of
Gedr&ocirc;sia. Among the cities he names are Argant&ecirc; (quoted
from Hekataios), Barygaza (Broach), Boukephala (Jal&acirc;lpur),

and monk, who wrote his Topographia Christiana between <span class="sc">a.d.</span>&nbsp;530 and 550, is the last of the ancient writers
who shows independent knowledge of India. He says that Sindu (Sindh),
is where India begins, the Indus being the boundary between it and
Persia. The chief ports of India are Sindu (Debal), which exports musk
and nard: Orrhotha (Sur&acirc;sh&#7789;ra that is Ver&acirc;val) which
had a king of its own: Kalliana (Kaly&acirc;n) a great port exporting
brass, and s&icirc;sam (blackwood) logs and cloth having a king of its
own and a community of Christians under a Persian bishop: Sibor which
also had a king of its own and therefore cannot be Sup&acirc;r&acirc;,
which is too close to Kalliana, but must be Goa, the Sindabur of the
Arabs: Parti, Mangaruth (Mangalor), Salopatana, Nalopatana, and
Pudopatana which are the five marts of Mal&ecirc; the pepper country
(Malab&acirc;r), where also there are many Christians. Five days&rsquo;
sail south of Mal&ecirc; lay Sielediba or Taproban&ecirc; (Ceylon),
divided into two kingdoms in one of which is found the hyacinth-stone.
The island has many temples, and a church of Persian Christians, and is
much resorted to by ships from India Persia and Ethiopia dealing in
silk, aloewood, cloves, sandalwood, &amp;c. On the east coast of India
is Marallo (Morava opposite Ceylon) whence conch-shells are exported:
Then Kaber (Kaveripatam or Pegu. Yule&rsquo;s Cathay Introd. page
clxxviii.) which exports Alabandinum; further on is the clove country
and furthest of all Tzinista (China) which produces the silk. In India
further up the country, that is further north, are the White Ounoi or
H&ucirc;&#7751;as who have a king named Gollas (Mihirakula of
inscriptions) who goes forth to war with 1000 elephants and many
horsemen and tyrannises over India, exacting tribute from the people.
His army is said to be so vast as once to have drunk dry the ditch
surrounding a besieged city and marched in dryshod.</p>
<p>In his book XI. Kosmas gives some account of the wild beasts of
India, but this part of his work does not require notice here.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (Prepared from
scans made by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. The digitized
holdings of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin are all
interested parties worldwide free of charge for
non-commercial use available.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
